<h1>Daily Travelogue</h1>
<p>While traveling, I do my best to write a few sentences a day in my little paper notebook. As I get access to the internet, I clean up some of these entries and post them here. Don't expect an update each day; I don't have Internet every day.</p>

<p>Where possible I just stick to the facts: <em>what, when, where</em>. If you want to know the <em>why</em>, head over to the less-frequently updated <a href="/articles.html">articles section</a> where I post long blobs of overengineered and annoyingly contemplative text.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Vilcabamba, Ecuador</p>

<p>After three weeks of biking along the sun-drenched coast of Ecuador, sucking
down coconut juice freshly freed from the husk by overly eager men with
machetes, following around cute and intriguing <em>artesanias</em>, and camping along
sandy bleached beaches, it was time stop for awhile and get some work done.</p>

<p>Spent several days in Cuenca, but the new client wasn’t quite ready for the
project to begin. So, I hightailed it to Loja in a two-day 200km sprint over
several mountain passes.</p>

<p>A good friend from Quito insisted Loja wasn’t particularly noteworthy, and if
I was going to sit in front of a computer for hours on end, I should do it in
a place with a view. So, 18 days ago I left Loja for the little village of
Vilcabamba (Sacred Valley).</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>She was right about the view.</p>

<p>The last two weeks I’ve been working hard; I put in over 50 hours this week. My
temporary residence has been the the gorgeous hostel of <a href="http://www.izhcayluma.de/">Izhcayluma</a>.
It is probably the best marketed hostel in all of Ecuador. Nearly everyone I’ve
met in Ecuador has recommended it. In addition to the steady stream of travelers making their way south or north
who stopover for a few days (or more) in Izhcayluma, people seem to come from
all over the world just to visit.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>Posing after arriving at Izhcayluma</p>
</div>

<p>While I’ve worked most of every day, invariably I took a break well past dark
to eat dinner and socialize with the current crop of guests. Three days seems
to be the time between turnovers, that is, the time after which I look up from
my computer, wipe the glaze off my eyes, and see all new faces.</p>

<p>I’ve met hundreds of people in my few weeks here, and, I would like to say, all
with interesting stories, but the truth is after the first week the stories all
start to sound the same. Though every couple days there is that one old man with great
tales of adventure from his youth or that young guy riding from Alaska to
Argentina on his motorcycle. I don’t mean to devalue anyone’s experiences, but
the unfortunate fact is <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html" title="The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride a bike">it has all been done before</a>.</p>

<p>People are interesting, every one of us, but among travelers travel
stories can be a bit repetitive. When faced with the inevitable hostel dinner
conversation (<em>“How long have you
been traveling? Wow! Where are you going? That’s cool. How much longer do you
have?”</em> etc.) I try to steer the conversation to something else: politics, pop
culture, technology, work, life, anything but travel.</p>

<p>That mini-rant out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I’ve met some awesome people and had great times. My ping pong game has seriously improved. As nice as Izhcayluma is (both in price and atmosphere)s, today I woke up with that itch. It’s time to move on.</p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow I leave for Peru.</strong></p>

<p>Well, I head in the direction of Peru. I suspect it will take me two days to
reach the border.</p>

<p>I’m taking the remote border crossing of Zumba - La Balsa, a remote and seldom
used crossing in the east of Ecuador/Peru. Remote and seldom used, because the
road is one-lane unpaved, dirt and gravel for hundreds of kilometers through
steep and windy mountain passes.</p>

<p><em>Why?!</em>, I ask myself,  am I taking the most difficult route into Peru? Well, there
are some legitimate reasons such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid the dirty, busy, and dangerous Pan Americana highway</li>
  <li>Avoid the central-northern part of Peru which is miles of tedious desert</li>
  <li>See some gorgeous vistas as I wind my way through the Andes</li>
</ul>

<p>But, ultimately, these are merely happy bonuses. The truth is that taking
the road less traveled on my definitely-not-a-mountain bike and spending weeks alone braving rain and muddy roads is exactly the sort of discomfort that makes for a good adventure. Maybe I have some underlying masochistic tendencies, though I prefer to frame it in the old adage <abbr title="Oh, god, how cliche of me">“<em>No Pain, No Gain</em>”</abbr>.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a bumpy ride.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Loja, Ecuador</p>

<p>Early morning in the little village of Oña. As much as I would like to roll out
of bed into my bike and down the road, I’m a slave to little morning rituals,
mostly involving coffee. This morning was no exception. Made some coffee in my
stove outside the Hotel, and shared a few cups with the owner, Antonio.</p>

<p>He was interested in my travels, mainly concerning what my family thought about
me traveling alone. We had an interesting discussion about the differences
between American and Ecuadorian culture regarding the importance of family. He
was quite surprised that I was one of only two children. His old face, gouged
and cracked from a lifetime of hard work, split into a wide, proud grin as he
exclaimed that he had had 8 sons and 2 daughters.</p>

<p>As I packed up my bike with its four panniers (bike bags) on each wheel, he watched intently
from the driveway. Giving me an astonished look, he asked how I stored my computers in such little space. The night before I had told him I was a <em>ingeniero sistemas</em> (‘computer engineer’, sort of), and he had taken that to mean I sold computers (like a traveling computer salesman). I attempted to explain that I didn’t sell anything physical, but rather sold this immaterial substance called ‘software’. Nodding heavily as if he was beginning to grasp the concept, he delicately asked if he could see some of this ‘software’ and wondered where I sold it. Unfortunately, my Spanish was just not up to the task of explaining that I sold intangible, invisible items at a phantasmic global market called the ‘Internet.’ I expect that would be difficult even in English.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-rRDGzzF/0/M/633797907494bcf4f83co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Antonio’s hotel in Oña. He was a bit shy for a picture.</p>

<p>Hit the road around 8am for the second leg of the journey from
Cuenca to Loja. The weather was kinder today, blue skies with puffy white
clouds covered me most of the day providing some gorgeous vistas.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-6h9ztHq/0/M/6351183644f2d6d371d6o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Road and Skies</p>

<p>Elevation change was more extreme than yesterday. I lost count of the number of
passes traversed. The day was a series of long, sustained climbs, followed by exhilarating, but oh so short, descents through windy mountain roads.</p>

<p><em>Gravity giveth, and gravity taketh away.</em></p>

<p>Riding in mountainous terrain has made me realize that patience and a steely
resolve are crucial when overcoming obstacles. With sufficient patience and
determination, I feel like I could do anything.</p>

<p>Stopped in the small town of Saraguro for lunch. Rice, beans, and chicken:
standard Ecuadorian fare. Can’t wait for Peru, if just for a change in food.</p>

<p>Near dusk, fog settled in. By that time I had been riding for about 9 hours and was thoroughly fatigued. Fog riding is mentally taxing. There is the extra attention that 
must be paid to vehicles and obstacles, yet more onerous is the visual
deprivation. You lose the sensation of progress, of forward movement.</p>

<p>Determined to reach Loja today, I rode into dark (in retrospect, not particularly smart). If fog riding in daylight is mentally taxing, doing the same, but in darkness, is punishing.</p>

<p>I rode for what seemed liked hours into the impenetrable blackness. I pulled out every mental trick I knew to force my legs to keep pumping and hands to keep gripping, until all thought fled and only raw instinctual movement remained.</p>

<p><em>It was a mindless toil.</em></p>

<p>The white line on black pavement was the only thing visible, a barely perceptible beacon of hope promising a way out of the void that had swallowed me. Dutifully, I followed.</p>

<p>And then, in a quiet moment–indistinguishable from those just passed–I road out of the murky vapor into a nocturnal mountainside. Beneath me, bathed in a purple light diffused through the mist, was the city.</p>

<p>There was an immense sigh that shuddered throughout everything. In that moment I found myself–but the sigh spent itself, the moment passed, and silence reigned.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-L8t8LJf/0/M/6351184758ff248ed51fo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I pointed my bike downhill and the silence was spoiled by the soft sound of
cool wind.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Oña, Ecuador</p>

<p>Heading from Cuenca to Loja today: 205km.</p>

<p>Departed from my hostel (Posado del Rio) in Cuenca around 7am after chatting it up with some other early risers over a cup of coffee. Navigation out of the city was easy enough using a map one of the lovely Hostel owners had given me.</p>

<p>About 10km or so out of Cuenca along level gray pavement lies the medium sized village of Cumbe. Stopped there to pick up some supplies in case I ended up wild camping in the mountains ahead. Tuna and mayonnaise, the perfect combination. Plenty of fat and protein to keep me going. Canned tuna keeps forever, as does this Ecuadorian mayo that doesn’t require refrigeration (or so they tell me).</p>

<p>Stumbled across the <em>mercado</em> (open air market with cheap adhoc restaurants),
and ended up relaxing for a bit for some more coffee and friendly conversation
with the locals.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-4f4G24p/0/M/6337971148fe40d1610eo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Whole roasted hog. Fresh all day.</p>

<p>I noticed a man with a bicycle cart proffering a
beverage in old grimy wine bottles. Curious, I asked to try a bit, to which he
responded by handing me a full (12oz) cup. The mysterious piping hot beverage was the
color of maple syrup, with the same consistency, and tasted like, well, plants. It wasn’t an unpleasant taste, mind you, but it wasn’t sweet. Only then did it occur to me to ask what it was: <em>aguardiente</em> (lit. “fiery water”, sugarcane liquor) in agave (the cactus) juice.</p>

<p>…and that was how I came to be pedaling out of Cumbe with a not-so-trifling buzz at
8am.</p>

<p>After Cumbe the road quickly turned uphill as I headed for my first, of several, 12,000 foot mountain passes. An hour or so into my ascent I stopped to rest on the
curb, and struck up a conversation with an ancient farmer, with skin like aged
brown leather and a sprightly step, tending to his mountain-side field. He
assured me with the utmost compassion that my ascent was almost over,
“<em>media hora en bicicleta, no mas</em>”, no more than half an hour to go by bike. Tossing a grateful “<em>muchas gracias, adios señor!</em>” over my shoulder I pushed off with a renewed vigor. This mountain was mine.</p>

<p>Two and a half hours later I reached what I suppose to be the summit, as instead
of constant uphill the terrain it morphed into rolling hills. I had a banana
to celebrate my victory and resolved not to ask locals about the length of ascents again. The mental deception is too taxing; just concentrate on the road you can see in front of you.</p>

Cheers! First mountain pass of the day conquered.</p>

<p>Ever since I had left Cuenca I had been fleeing from ominous storm clouds; around
1pm they caught me. With the cold, harsh rain came a dense gray fog. The following several hours were some of the most thrilling riding I’ve done. Screaming down mountain passes, taking curves with 10 feet of visibility, all the while squinting in pain through the cold torrent, is a singular experience. Several hoots and hollers were belted out in my adrenaline filled furor.</p>

Right before the rain came the fog.</p>

<p>Eventually the rain and fog passed as I descended about 3,300 ft into a village, only to find another 3,500 foot ascent waiting for me. This time around I was chasing the sun into dusk. Determined to summit before dark, I pushed on; a multicultural medley of Spanish, English, and Arabic curse words carried me to the peak.</p>

<p>Knees wrung, thighs cramping, and mental faculties slightly unhinged I drifted the last four or five miles in a giddy delirium to the small pueblo of Oña (200 people) where I staggered up one final dirt hill to the only hotel and into bed as the sun sunk behind the horizon.</p>

<p>Half way to Loja. 100km down, 105km more to go. Tomorrow is looking to be more of the same.</p>

<p>Cuenca is a gorgeous city (even when it is raining).</p>

<p>Cuenca, however, is not a city for bicycles. If it isn’t the lumpy
centuries-old cobblestone rattling the teeth right out of your skull, then it
is the villainous truck/bus drivers who have some sort of elaborate, callous
plan to rid their streets of cyclists.</p>

<p>More work today. Took the bike out for a short spin to do some errands (ATM,
coffee, spare nuts ‘n bolts), hence the mini rant. Leaving tomorrow bright and early, that is the plan.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cuenca, Ecuador</p>

<p>Sunday I left Salinas for Cuenca. By bus. I feel guilty for having skipped over
400km in just a few hours, when I’m supposed to by cycling across South
America, not “cycling most of the time, but when I get lazy I take a bus too.”</p>

<p>Oh well, I’m not torn up about it. The fact is I want to get to Peru sooner,
and some tentative plans I had to do the Galapagos on the cheap fell through.
Turns out taking a cargo ship from Guayaquil to the Galapagos is as expensive
as flying. Bummed, I won’t be able to see Janet, Wendy, or John over there.
Wish them the best of luck.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/25087492_6XqkGp"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/i-c3xshsH/0/L/6264740255dabef617e9o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So Sunday was spent on a bus. Arrived in Cuenca around 5pm. While I had been
here before, I wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood near the bus station. Once
again I implemented my strategy of pedaling off in a good looking direction.
Once again that strategy proved fruitful, in about 30 minutes I found downtown
Cuenca. (reminder to self: patent this brilliant method)</p>

<p>From there I remembered the way to one of my favorite hostels: <a href="http://www.hosteltrail.com/posadadelriocuenca/" title="Posada del Rio">Posada del Rio</a>. This place rocks. Fantastic kitchen, lots of
tableware, cooking utensils, and most importantly a giant stove with 6 burners.
In a busy hostel, with tons of people cooking, the kitchen can get crowded.
Superb wifi (also available in the rooms). A large spacious common area. Clean,
cozy-yet-not-too-cozy-if-you-know-what-i-mean dorms. Best of all is the crowd
it tends to attract: budget travelers who aren’t afraid to come out of their
shells. Nearly every night there’s a large group dinner as people pool
their food.</p>

<p>Today it rained. All day. Didn’t go out, except to scrounge up some grub.
Took advantage of the fast Internet to do some much needed work. I’m getting
used to being that weirdo in the corner on the computer all day.</p>

<p>Had a mini Lord of the Rings marathon in the evening with a Frenchman and two
Canadian girls. Itching to get back on the bike.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Set out early. Thanked the nice owner of the hosteria that let me pitch my tent
for free. Tried to pay her a few dollars, but she wasn’t having any of it.</p>

<p>Stopped after about 10mi for some breakfast at a little cabana along the beach.
Eggs, coffee, and some wind blown sand.. mmmmhmmm.</p>

<p>After the little mountain pass outside Puerto Lopez, the terrain has been more or
less flat. Riding into the urbanized area of La Libertad and Salinas was quite
a change from the calm rural riding of the past couple days. Lots of vehicles,
lots of exhaust. Egh. Do not like riding in urban centers.</p>

<p>Rode around Salinas for several hours. I really had no clue where I was or where I was going. That proved to be a solid plan, because I happened across a nice little place called “<em>Hospedaje Beach Camping</em>”. They
weren’t really on the beach, but they had a nice courtyard to setup my tent in.
Hot showers, shared bathroom, security, $4. Slightly expensive, but a huge
Ecuadorian holiday is just ending, so the price would’ve been lower had
I arrived a day later.</p>

<p>Placed my tent adjacent to a tent belonging to a nice Uruguayan couple traveling north. We exchanged tips about good camping sites, and couch surfing contacts. Got a preview of the crazy Spanish accent awaiting me when I get down to Argentina and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Today was the official conclusion of the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> portion of my bike
tour. The Ecuadorian coast is beautiful, full of friendly happy people, yummy seafood, and plenty of sun. The roads are in great condition. Most of the route had shoulders. In those stretches without shoulders, drivers were courteous and respectful.</p>

<p>Still haven’t finalized plans for what comes next. Will do that tomorrow.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Finally dragged myself out of Puerto Lopez today. Five (six? I lost count) days
there was way more than I should have spent. Though, the combination of people,
sun, sand, and ocean was just too difficult to decline.</p>

<p>Bought a bracelet from one of the artesanias. It has my alma mater’s colors,
which is probably why it caught my eye, because my school spirit isn’t particularly fierce. A little token for remembering, something I’m also usually not so keen on.</p>

<p>It was well past 2pm when I started the ascent out of town up that big hill
to the south I had been eyeing all week.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056132721"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-FsnVvV3/0/M/63204212006fbd6d3410o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Looking back on Puerto Lopez from the hill</p>

<p>After that hill I didn’t expect to make it far,
especially because of a small mountain pass about 20mi away. Surprisingly,
despite the fact my legs turned to flub after 5 days of beach living, I made it
a solid 40mi, well past the mountain pass. No pictures from that giant uphill
ride. Buses cutting into the nonexistent shoulder and savage dogs
attempting to take chunks from my calves, didn’t leave much opportunity for
photographs.</p>

<p>Road about an hour into dark. First time night riding in Ecuador, wouldn’t
recommend it. There weren’t any suitable wild camping spots, so I road along in
my red and white blinking glory until I chanced upon a small <em>hosteria</em> in
Colonche. They didn’t have any rooms, but <em>la senora</em> graciously allowed me to setup my tent in an open space out front. For free! Tuna fish with mayonnaise for dinner.</p>
