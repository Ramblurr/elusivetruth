<h1>Daily Travelogue</h1>
<p>While traveling, I do my best to write a few sentences a day in my little paper notebook. As I get access to the internet, I clean up some of these entries and post them here. Don't expect an update each day; I don't have Internet every day.</p>

<p>Where possible I just stick to the facts: <em>what, when, where</em>. If you want to know the <em>why</em>, head over to the less-frequently updated <a href="/articles.html">articles section</a> where I post long blobs of overengineered and annoyingly contemplative text.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cuenca, Ecuador</p>

<p>Sunday I left Salinas for Cuenca. By bus. I feel guilty for having skipped over
400km in just a few hours, when I’m supposed to by cycling across South
America, not “cycling most of the time, but when I get lazy I take a bus too.”</p>

<p>Oh well, I’m not torn up about it. The fact is I want to get to Peru sooner,
and some tentative plans I had to do the Galapagos on the cheap fell through.
Turns out taking a cargo ship from Guayaquil to the Galapagos is as expensive
as flying. Bummed, I won’t be able to see Janet, Wendy, or John over there.
Wish them the best of luck.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/25087492_6XqkGp"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/i-c3xshsH/0/L/6264740255dabef617e9o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So Sunday was spent on a bus. Arrived in Cuenca around 5pm. While I had been
here before, I wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood near the bus station. Once
again I implemented my strategy of pedaling off in a good looking direction.
Once again that strategy proved fruitful, in about 30 minutes I found downtown
Cuenca. (reminder to self: patent this brilliant method)</p>

<p>From there I remembered the way to one of my favorite hostels: <a href="http://www.hosteltrail.com/posadadelriocuenca/" title="Posada del Rio">Posada del Rio</a>. This place rocks. Fantastic kitchen, lots of
tableware, cooking utensils, and most importantly a giant stove with 6 burners.
In a busy hostel, with tons of people cooking, the kitchen can get crowded.
Superb wifi (also available in the rooms). A large spacious common area. Clean,
cozy-yet-not-too-cozy-if-you-know-what-i-mean dorms. Best of all is the crowd
it tends to attract: budget travelers who aren’t afraid to come out of their
shells. Nearly every night there’s a large group dinner as people pool
their food.</p>

<p>Today it rained. All day. Didn’t go out, except to scrounge up some grub.
Took advantage of the fast Internet to do some much needed work. I’m getting
used to being that weirdo in the corner on the computer all day.</p>

<p>Had a mini Lord of the Rings marathon in the evening with a Frenchman and two
Canadian girls. Itching to get back on the bike.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Set out early. Thanked the nice owner of the hosteria that let me pitch my tent
for free. Tried to pay her a few dollars, but she wasn’t having any of it.</p>

<p>Stopped after about 10mi for some breakfast at a little cabana along the beach.
Eggs, coffee, and some wind blown sand.. mmmmhmmm.</p>

<p>After the little mountain pass outside Puerto Lopez, the terrain has been more or
less flat. Riding into the urbanized area of La Libertad and Salinas was quite
a change from the calm rural riding of the past couple days. Lots of vehicles,
lots of exhaust. Egh. Do not like riding in urban centers.</p>

<p>Rode around Salinas for several hours. I really had no clue where I was or where I was going. That proved to be a solid plan, because I happened across a nice little place called “<em>Hospedaje Beach Camping</em>”. They
weren’t really on the beach, but they had a nice courtyard to setup my tent in.
Hot showers, shared bathroom, security, $4. Slightly expensive, but a huge
Ecuadorian holiday is just ending, so the price would’ve been lower had
I arrived a day later.</p>

<p>Placed my tent adjacent to a tent belonging to a nice Uruguayan couple traveling north. We exchanged tips about good camping sites, and couch surfing contacts. Got a preview of the crazy Spanish accent awaiting me when I get down to Argentina and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Today was the official conclusion of the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> portion of my bike
tour. The Ecuadorian coast is beautiful, full of friendly happy people, yummy seafood, and plenty of sun. The roads are in great condition. Most of the route had shoulders. In those stretches without shoulders, drivers were courteous and respectful.</p>

<p>Still haven’t finalized plans for what comes next. Will do that tomorrow.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Finally dragged myself out of Puerto Lopez today. Five (six? I lost count) days
there was way more than I should have spent. Though, the combination of people,
sun, sand, and ocean was just too difficult to decline.</p>

<p>Bought a bracelet from one of the artesanias. It has my alma mater’s colors,
which is probably why it caught my eye, because my school spirit isn’t particularly fierce. A little token for remembering, something I’m also usually not so keen on.</p>

<p>It was well past 2pm when I started the ascent out of town up that big hill
to the south I had been eyeing all week.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056132721"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-FsnVvV3/0/M/63204212006fbd6d3410o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Looking back on Puerto Lopez from the hill</p>

<p>After that hill I didn’t expect to make it far,
especially because of a small mountain pass about 20mi away. Surprisingly,
despite the fact my legs turned to flub after 5 days of beach living, I made it
a solid 40mi, well past the mountain pass. No pictures from that giant uphill
ride. Buses cutting into the nonexistent shoulder and savage dogs
attempting to take chunks from my calves, didn’t leave much opportunity for
photographs.</p>

<p>Road about an hour into dark. First time night riding in Ecuador, wouldn’t
recommend it. There weren’t any suitable wild camping spots, so I road along in
my red and white blinking glory until I chanced upon a small <em>hosteria</em> in
Colonche. They didn’t have any rooms, but <em>la senora</em> graciously allowed me to setup my tent in an open space out front. For free! Tuna fish with mayonnaise for dinner.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Visited Isla de la Plata yesterday. It is a little island covered in scrub
about 1 hour from Puerto Lopez by boat. Some call it the poor man’s Galapagos
Islands, for it possible to a small handful of species there that also reside
on the Galapagos.</p>

<p>It was quite enjoyable, even though it was the dry season, so most of the
island’s vegetation was dry and dead. Saw <strong>A LOT</strong> of blue footed boobies, many of
which had nested right on the trail.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-8ZdR9p9/0/M/63066169230f29fb4a5fo-M.jpg" alt="Two blue-footed boobies and their chick" /></a>
Two blue-footed boobies and their chick.</p>

<p>On the way to the island a pod of dolphins followed us for a way, frolicking in
the surf kicked up by our skiff. In the bay we also caught site of a cute, lonely, sea turtle who was interested in the side of our boat.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-ZKNbpwW/0/M/6307136562aecbd2204do-S.jpg" alt="a" /></a>
A curious sea turtle</p>

<p>Today, spent several hours working and reading, then spent the evening
hanging out in the village’s main plaza with the <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/11/01/daily.html" title=""><em>artesanias</em></a> I mentioned last time. They are a fun and laid-back
group. I admire their freedom. No ties to one place, no societal obligations.
Liberty requires living with the barest essentials, a purposeful absence of
possessions and relationships. It is a truly selfish state of being. Freedom isn’t for everyone. Is it for me? Don’t I want to <em>matter</em>?</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Puerto Lopez is a small fishing village on the Pacific coast. Yesterday, just
after dawn, I went down to the beach as the fishermen were pulling in from their long
night of fishing. Saw some pretty cool catches: little hammerhead sharks, big
colorful tunas, and even a 7-foot long shark.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056131584&amp;k=F9RTsvq&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-F9RTsvq/0/S/63066146097cd7408030o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Ended up working the rest of the morning and afternoon, then rode my bike around town in the evening. They don’t celebrate Halloween here.</p>

<p>Met some interesting travelers on the beach last night: Two girls, Canadian and
Chilean, traveling
separately and alone, who make artisanal crafts (necklaces, little bags,
bracelets, etc) from beads, hemp, bone, shells, etc. When I ran across them they were picking up shells from the beach to use in their creations. They wander from place to place, setting up little tables in the center of towns to sell their art. They live on less than $10 per day.</p>

<p>It’s not a tough life, but it isn’t easy either. Ignoring the fact I have no creative inclinations in that regard, if I couldn’t work over the Internet, I could easily see myself ending up like them to support a nomadic lifestyle. Maybe I would be the wandering computer repair hobo.</p>

<p>Today I’m taking a little tour to <em>Isla de la Plata</em> (Island of Silver), also
known as the Poor man’s Galapagos, to see a few species of animals found on the
Galapagos islands. Birds, sea turtles, and with luck some dolphins and perhaps 
a whale.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Short ride today. After two days of riding past gorgeous beaches, I’m stopping
in Puerto Lopez for several days to enjoy the surf, and see some local sights.</p>

<p>Found a great hostel (Hostel Maxima) 1 block from the beach. The kind owners graciously
allowed me to setup my tent in the large grassy courtyward for only $2 per night with access to the shared
bathrooms, kitchen, and oh-so-important WiFi.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Cayo, Ecuador</p>

<p>Today was my first official day on the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> (Route of the Sun), the
coastal route along Ecuador’s coast.</p>

<p>Woke up early. Had some horrible instant coffee and a plate of eggs with cheese
at a little restaurant across the street. Stopped by an internet cafe to
consult Google about the best route out of town. Navigating cities is pretty
daunting, I prefer the open rural roads.</p>

<p>Stopped by a gas station on my way out to fill up my stove’s fuel bottle with
gas. The attendants and patrons got a kick out of me waiting in line with the
cars for my turn to wheel up to the pump.</p>

<p>1 full fuel canister = 22 cents</p>

<p>Biked about 50 miles to the small coastal village of Puerto Cayo. When I pictured biking the 150 or so miles of the <em>Ruta del Sol</em>, I imagined
a leisurely ride under the gentle caress of the sun, along a smooth beach road, never to far from the surf. When I tired, I would simply pull over and enjoy the sweet fresh nectar from a downed coconut.</p>

<p>Turns out the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> at this season isn’t particularly sunny, but when
the sun does show itself it is an intense and painful. Of course I forgot
sunscreen. Now I’m not just the strange guy on a bike, I’m the strange beet-colored gringo on a bike.</p>

<p>It also turns out the route itself is quite hilly, with many climbs and
descents. Nothing to steep, but more than I was expecting. Oh, and those
coconuts cost a $1 each, as the locals have already collected them for sale.</p>

<p>Illusion shattered. Oh well, I’m having a blast despite the hills and raging sunburn.</p>

First glimpse of the ocean!</p>
