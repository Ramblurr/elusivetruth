                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Guayaquil, Ecuador</p>

<p>Flight from Miami was uneventful. Successfully retrieved my bicycle from the
baggage claim and passed through customs with only cursory glance from the
officials. They seemed more interested in the little boxes of electronics Ecuadorians
were bringing home, than my large, table-sized box.</p>

<p>Finding a taxi proved challenging, as none of the little foreign four-doors
could fit the large bicycle box. After much frantic scrambling on their part–the <em>taxistas</em> didn’t want to lose my business, even though I wasn’t going anywhere without their help–they found a driver with a hatchback and I made it to the hostel before noon.</p>

<p>Postponed assembling my bike as work was calling. Worked all afternoon.</p>

<p>Worked all day in the hostel lobby. Who knows what the staff and other patrons
(all Ecuadorian) thought of the weird, nerdy gringo camped in front of his
computer for 8+ hours.</p>

<p>Broke up the bike box in the early afternoon. Amazingly, there was no damage to the frame, despite my shoddy packing job. Assembly was straightforward, and after tweaking the front brake, everything appeared to be working. Took it for a spin in the golden dusk on the streets of Guayaquil. Ate Chinese again.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Manta, Ecuador</p>

<p>A weekend of work suddenly dissolved after a short conference call in the
morning. With that out of the way it was time to hit the road.</p>

<p>Packed up my panniers, attached them to the bike and made off for the bus station in the early afternoon. Ticket for the 4-hour journey from Guayaquil to Manta by bus was $4. Decided to bus it because I’m itching to get to the coast, and I’ve received quite a few warnings that biking out of Guayaquil isn’t the best idea. My bike wasn’t the strangest thing to go underneath the bus, one family had a live goat they tethered next to my bike.</p>

<p>The bus ride was fun. Sat next to a stunning Ecuadorian girl with long coffee colored hair and a cute chubby little boy who loved to pull at my whiskers. Arrived in Manta shortly before dusk. No reservation. No map. No guidebook.
Just my loaded bike and some grimy busy streets to explore. Took off in
a direction that looked promising. Passed by the beach, saw a hostel sign: $10 for
the night, private room+bathroom, “hot water”, and cable TV. Good enough.</p>

<p>Weekend Ho!</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Cayo, Ecuador</p>

<p>Today was my first official day on the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> (Route of the Sun), the
coastal route along Ecuador’s coast.</p>

<p>Woke up early. Had some horrible instant coffee and a plate of eggs with cheese
at a little restaurant across the street. Stopped by an internet cafe to
consult Google about the best route out of town. Navigating cities is pretty
daunting, I prefer the open rural roads.</p>

<p>Stopped by a gas station on my way out to fill up my stove’s fuel bottle with
gas. The attendants and patrons got a kick out of me waiting in line with the
cars for my turn to wheel up to the pump.</p>

<p>1 full fuel canister = 22 cents</p>

<p>Biked about 50 miles to the small coastal village of Puerto Cayo. When I pictured biking the 150 or so miles of the <em>Ruta del Sol</em>, I imagined
a leisurely ride under the gentle caress of the sun, along a smooth beach road, never to far from the surf. When I tired, I would simply pull over and enjoy the sweet fresh nectar from a downed coconut.</p>

<p>Turns out the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> at this season isn’t particularly sunny, but when
the sun does show itself it is an intense and painful. Of course I forgot
sunscreen. Now I’m not just the strange guy on a bike, I’m the strange beet-colored gringo on a bike.</p>

<p>It also turns out the route itself is quite hilly, with many climbs and
descents. Nothing to steep, but more than I was expecting. Oh, and those
coconuts cost a $1 each, as the locals have already collected them for sale.</p>

<p>Illusion shattered. Oh well, I’m having a blast despite the hills and raging sunburn.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Short ride today. After two days of riding past gorgeous beaches, I’m stopping
in Puerto Lopez for several days to enjoy the surf, and see some local sights.</p>

<p>Found a great hostel (Hostel Maxima) 1 block from the beach. The kind owners graciously
allowed me to setup my tent in the large grassy courtyward for only $2 per night with access to the shared
bathrooms, kitchen, and oh-so-important WiFi.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Puerto Lopez is a small fishing village on the Pacific coast. Yesterday, just
after dawn, I went down to the beach as the fishermen were pulling in from their long
night of fishing. Saw some pretty cool catches: little hammerhead sharks, big
colorful tunas, and even a 7-foot long shark.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056131584&amp;k=F9RTsvq&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-F9RTsvq/0/S/63066146097cd7408030o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Ended up working the rest of the morning and afternoon, then rode my bike around town in the evening. They don’t celebrate Halloween here.</p>

<p>Met some interesting travelers on the beach last night: Two girls, Canadian and
Chilean, traveling
separately and alone, who make artisanal crafts (necklaces, little bags,
bracelets, etc) from beads, hemp, bone, shells, etc. When I ran across them they were picking up shells from the beach to use in their creations. They wander from place to place, setting up little tables in the center of towns to sell their art. They live on less than $10 per day.</p>

<p>It’s not a tough life, but it isn’t easy either. Ignoring the fact I have no creative inclinations in that regard, if I couldn’t work over the Internet, I could easily see myself ending up like them to support a nomadic lifestyle. Maybe I would be the wandering computer repair hobo.</p>

<p>Today I’m taking a little tour to <em>Isla de la Plata</em> (Island of Silver), also
known as the Poor man’s Galapagos, to see a few species of animals found on the
Galapagos islands. Birds, sea turtles, and with luck some dolphins and perhaps 
a whale.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</p>

<p>Visited Isla de la Plata yesterday. It is a little island covered in scrub
about 1 hour from Puerto Lopez by boat. Some call it the poor man’s Galapagos
Islands, for it possible to a small handful of species there that also reside
on the Galapagos.</p>

<p>It was quite enjoyable, even though it was the dry season, so most of the
island’s vegetation was dry and dead. Saw <strong>A LOT</strong> of blue footed boobies, many of
which had nested right on the trail.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-8ZdR9p9/0/M/63066169230f29fb4a5fo-M.jpg" alt="Two blue-footed boobies and their chick" /></a>

<p>On the way to the island a pod of dolphins followed us for a way, frolicking in
the surf kicked up by our skiff. In the bay we also caught site of a cute, lonely, sea turtle who was interested in the side of our boat.</p>

<p>Today, spent several hours working and reading, then spent the evening
hanging out in the village’s main plaza with the <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/11/01/daily.html" title=""><em>artesanias</em></a> I mentioned last time. They are a fun and laid-back
group. I admire their freedom. No ties to one place, no societal obligations.
Liberty requires living with the barest essentials, a purposeful absence of
possessions and relationships. It is a truly selfish state of being. Freedom isn’t for everyone. Is it for me? Don’t I want to <em>matter</em>?</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Finally dragged myself out of Puerto Lopez today. Five (six? I lost count) days
there was way more than I should have spent. Though, the combination of people,
sun, sand, and ocean was just too difficult to decline.</p>

<p>Bought a bracelet from one of the artesanias. It has my alma mater’s colors,
which is probably why it caught my eye, because my school spirit isn’t particularly fierce. A little token for remembering, something I’m also usually not so keen on.</p>

<p>It was well past 2pm when I started the ascent out of town up that big hill
to the south I had been eyeing all week.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056132721"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-FsnVvV3/0/M/63204212006fbd6d3410o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Looking back on Puerto Lopez from the hill</p>

<p>After that hill I didn’t expect to make it far,
especially because of a small mountain pass about 20mi away. Surprisingly,
despite the fact my legs turned to flub after 5 days of beach living, I made it
a solid 40mi, well past the mountain pass. No pictures from that giant uphill
ride. Buses cutting into the nonexistent shoulder and savage dogs
attempting to take chunks from my calves, didn’t leave much opportunity for
photographs.</p>

<p>Road about an hour into dark. First time night riding in Ecuador, wouldn’t
recommend it. There weren’t any suitable wild camping spots, so I road along in
my red and white blinking glory until I chanced upon a small <em>hosteria</em> in
Colonche. They didn’t have any rooms, but <em>la senora</em> graciously allowed me to setup my tent in an open space out front. For free! Tuna fish with mayonnaise for dinner.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Salinas, Ecuador</p>

<p>Set out early. Thanked the nice owner of the hosteria that let me pitch my tent
for free. Tried to pay her a few dollars, but she wasn’t having any of it.</p>

<p>Stopped after about 10mi for some breakfast at a little cabana along the beach.
Eggs, coffee, and some wind blown sand.. mmmmhmmm.</p>

<p>After the little mountain pass outside Puerto Lopez, the terrain has been more or
less flat. Riding into the urbanized area of La Libertad and Salinas was quite
a change from the calm rural riding of the past couple days. Lots of vehicles,
lots of exhaust. Egh. Do not like riding in urban centers.</p>

<p>Rode around Salinas for several hours. I really had no clue where I was or where I was going. That proved to be a solid plan, because I happened across a nice little place called “<em>Hospedaje Beach Camping</em>”. They
weren’t really on the beach, but they had a nice courtyard to setup my tent in.
Hot showers, shared bathroom, security, $4. Slightly expensive, but a huge
Ecuadorian holiday is just ending, so the price would’ve been lower had
I arrived a day later.</p>

<p>Placed my tent adjacent to a tent belonging to a nice Uruguayan couple traveling north. We exchanged tips about good camping sites, and couch surfing contacts. Got a preview of the crazy Spanish accent awaiting me when I get down to Argentina and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Today was the official conclusion of the <em>Ruta del Sol</em> portion of my bike
tour. The Ecuadorian coast is beautiful, full of friendly happy people, yummy seafood, and plenty of sun. The roads are in great condition. Most of the route had shoulders. In those stretches without shoulders, drivers were courteous and respectful.</p>

<p>Still haven’t finalized plans for what comes next. Will do that tomorrow.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cuenca, Ecuador</p>

<p>Sunday I left Salinas for Cuenca. By bus. I feel guilty for having skipped over
400km in just a few hours, when I’m supposed to by cycling across South
America, not “cycling most of the time, but when I get lazy I take a bus too.”</p>

<p>Oh well, I’m not torn up about it. The fact is I want to get to Peru sooner,
and some tentative plans I had to do the Galapagos on the cheap fell through.
Turns out taking a cargo ship from Guayaquil to the Galapagos is as expensive
as flying. Bummed, I won’t be able to see Janet, Wendy, or John over there.
Wish them the best of luck.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/25087492_6XqkGp"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/i-c3xshsH/0/L/6264740255dabef617e9o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So Sunday was spent on a bus. Arrived in Cuenca around 5pm. While I had been
here before, I wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood near the bus station. Once
again I implemented my strategy of pedaling off in a good looking direction.
Once again that strategy proved fruitful, in about 30 minutes I found downtown
Cuenca. (reminder to self: patent this brilliant method)</p>

<p>From there I remembered the way to one of my favorite hostels: <a href="http://www.hosteltrail.com/posadadelriocuenca/" title="Posada del Rio">Posada del Rio</a>. This place rocks. Fantastic kitchen, lots of
tableware, cooking utensils, and most importantly a giant stove with 6 burners.
In a busy hostel, with tons of people cooking, the kitchen can get crowded.
Superb wifi (also available in the rooms). A large spacious common area. Clean,
cozy-yet-not-too-cozy-if-you-know-what-i-mean dorms. Best of all is the crowd
it tends to attract: budget travelers who aren’t afraid to come out of their
shells. Nearly every night there’s a large group dinner as people pool
their food.</p>

<p>Today it rained. All day. Didn’t go out, except to scrounge up some grub.
Took advantage of the fast Internet to do some much needed work. I’m getting
used to being that weirdo in the corner on the computer all day.</p>

<p>Had a mini Lord of the Rings marathon in the evening with a Frenchman and two
Canadian girls. Itching to get back on the bike.</p>

<p>Cuenca is a gorgeous city (even when it is raining).</p>

In Cuenca’s main plaza (photo by my friend Kate)</p>

<p>Cuenca, however, is not a city for bicycles. If it isn’t the lumpy
centuries-old cobblestone rattling the teeth right out of your skull, then it
is the villainous truck/bus drivers who have some sort of elaborate, callous
plan to rid their streets of cyclists.</p>

<p>More work today. Took the bike out for a short spin to do some errands (ATM,
coffee, spare nuts ‘n bolts), hence the mini rant. Leaving tomorrow bright and early, that is the plan.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Oña, Ecuador</p>

<p>Heading from Cuenca to Loja today: 205km.</p>

<p>Departed from my hostel (Posado del Rio) in Cuenca around 7am after chatting it up with some other early risers over a cup of coffee. Navigation out of the city was easy enough using a map one of the lovely Hostel owners had given me.</p>

<p>About 10km or so out of Cuenca along level gray pavement lies the medium sized village of Cumbe. Stopped there to pick up some supplies in case I ended up wild camping in the mountains ahead. Tuna and mayonnaise, the perfect combination. Plenty of fat and protein to keep me going. Canned tuna keeps forever, as does this Ecuadorian mayo that doesn’t require refrigeration (or so they tell me).</p>

<p>Stumbled across the <em>mercado</em> (open air market with cheap adhoc restaurants),
and ended up relaxing for a bit for some more coffee and friendly conversation
with the locals.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-4f4G24p/0/M/6337971148fe40d1610eo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Whole roasted hog. Fresh all day.</p>

<p>I noticed a man with a bicycle cart proffering a
beverage in old grimy wine bottles. Curious, I asked to try a bit, to which he
responded by handing me a full (12oz) cup. The mysterious piping hot beverage was the
color of maple syrup, with the same consistency, and tasted like, well, plants. It wasn’t an unpleasant taste, mind you, but it wasn’t sweet. Only then did it occur to me to ask what it was: <em>aguardiente</em> (lit. “fiery water”, sugarcane liquor) in agave (the cactus) juice.</p>

<p>…and that was how I came to be pedaling out of Cumbe with a not-so-trifling buzz at
8am.</p>

<p>After Cumbe the road quickly turned uphill as I headed for my first, of several, 12,000 foot mountain passes. An hour or so into my ascent I stopped to rest on the
curb, and struck up a conversation with an ancient farmer, with skin like aged
brown leather and a sprightly step, tending to his mountain-side field. He
assured me with the utmost compassion that my ascent was almost over,
“<em>media hora en bicicleta, no mas</em>”, no more than half an hour to go by bike. Tossing a grateful “<em>muchas gracias, adios señor!</em>” over my shoulder I pushed off with a renewed vigor. This mountain was mine.</p>

<p>Two and a half hours later I reached what I suppose to be the summit, as instead
of constant uphill the terrain it morphed into rolling hills. I had a banana
to celebrate my victory and resolved not to ask locals about the length of ascents again. The mental deception is too taxing; just concentrate on the road you can see in front of you.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-ndSZLPk/0/M/633796976214bfd89d28o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Cheers! First mountain pass of the day conquered.</p>

<p>Ever since I had left Cuenca I had been fleeing from ominous storm clouds; around
1pm they caught me. With the cold, harsh rain came a dense gray fog. The following several hours were some of the most thrilling riding I’ve done. Screaming down mountain passes, taking curves with 10 feet of visibility, all the while squinting in pain through the cold torrent, is a singular experience. Several hoots and hollers were belted out in my adrenaline filled furor.</p>

Right before the rain came the fog.</p>

<p>Eventually the rain and fog passed as I descended about 3,300 ft into a village, only to find another 3,500 foot ascent waiting for me. This time around I was chasing the sun into dusk. Determined to summit before dark, I pushed on; a multicultural medley of Spanish, English, and Arabic curse words carried me to the peak.</p>

<p>Knees wrung, thighs cramping, and mental faculties slightly unhinged I drifted the last four or five miles in a giddy delirium to the small pueblo of Oña (200 people) where I staggered up one final dirt hill to the only hotel and into bed as the sun sunk behind the horizon.</p>

<p>Half way to Loja. 100km down, 105km more to go. Tomorrow is looking to be more of the same.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Loja, Ecuador</p>

<p>Early morning in the little village of Oña. As much as I would like to roll out
of bed into my bike and down the road, I’m a slave to little morning rituals,
mostly involving coffee. This morning was no exception. Made some coffee in my
stove outside the Hotel, and shared a few cups with the owner, Antonio.</p>

<p>He was interested in my travels, mainly concerning what my family thought about
me traveling alone. We had an interesting discussion about the differences
between American and Ecuadorian culture regarding the importance of family. He
was quite surprised that I was one of only two children. His old face, gouged
and cracked from a lifetime of hard work, split into a wide, proud grin as he
exclaimed that he had had 8 sons and 2 daughters.</p>

<p>As I packed up my bike with its four panniers (bike bags) on each wheel, he watched intently
from the driveway. Giving me an astonished look, he asked how I stored my computers in such little space. The night before I had told him I was a <em>ingeniero sistemas</em> (‘computer engineer’, sort of), and he had taken that to mean I sold computers (like a traveling computer salesman). I attempted to explain that I didn’t sell anything physical, but rather sold this immaterial substance called ‘software’. Nodding heavily as if he was beginning to grasp the concept, he delicately asked if he could see some of this ‘software’ and wondered where I sold it. Unfortunately, my Spanish was just not up to the task of explaining that I sold intangible, invisible items at a phantasmic global market called the ‘Internet.’ I expect that would be difficult even in English.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-rRDGzzF/0/M/633797907494bcf4f83co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Antonio’s hotel in Oña. He was a bit shy for a picture.</p>

<p>Hit the road around 8am for the second leg of the journey from
Cuenca to Loja. The weather was kinder today, blue skies with puffy white
clouds covered me most of the day providing some gorgeous vistas.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-6h9ztHq/0/M/6351183644f2d6d371d6o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Road and Skies</p>

<p>Elevation change was more extreme than yesterday. I lost count of the number of
passes traversed. The day was a series of long, sustained climbs, followed by exhilarating, but oh so short, descents through windy mountain roads.</p>

<p><em>Gravity giveth, and gravity taketh away.</em></p>

<p>Riding in mountainous terrain has made me realize that patience and a steely
resolve are crucial when overcoming obstacles. With sufficient patience and
determination, I feel like I could do anything.</p>

<p>Stopped in the small town of Saraguro for lunch. Rice, beans, and chicken:
standard Ecuadorian fare. Can’t wait for Peru, if just for a change in food.</p>

<p>Near dusk, fog settled in. By that time I had been riding for about 9 hours and was thoroughly fatigued. Fog riding is mentally taxing. There is the extra attention that 
must be paid to vehicles and obstacles, yet more onerous is the visual
deprivation. You lose the sensation of progress, of forward movement.</p>

<p>Determined to reach Loja today, I rode into dark (in retrospect, not particularly smart). If fog riding in daylight is mentally taxing, doing the same, but in darkness, is punishing.</p>

<p>I rode for what seemed liked hours into the impenetrable blackness. I pulled out every mental trick I knew to force my legs to keep pumping and hands to keep gripping, until all thought fled and only raw instinctual movement remained.</p>

<p><em>It was a mindless toil.</em></p>

<p>The white line on black pavement was the only thing visible, a barely perceptible beacon of hope promising a way out of the void that had swallowed me. Dutifully, I followed.</p>

<p>And then, in a quiet moment–indistinguishable from those just passed–I road out of the murky vapor into a nocturnal mountainside. Beneath me, bathed in a purple light diffused through the mist, was the city.</p>

<p>There was an immense sigh that shuddered throughout everything. In that moment I found myself–but the sigh spent itself, the moment passed, and silence reigned.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-L8t8LJf/0/M/6351184758ff248ed51fo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I pointed my bike downhill and the silence was spoiled by the soft sound of
cool wind.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Vilcabamba, Ecuador</p>

<p>After three weeks of biking along the sun-drenched coast of Ecuador, sucking
down coconut juice freshly freed from the husk by overly eager men with
machetes, following around cute and intriguing <em>artesanias</em>, and camping along
sandy bleached beaches, it was time stop for awhile and get some work done.</p>

<p>Spent several days in Cuenca, but the new client wasn’t quite ready for the
project to begin. So, I hightailed it to Loja in a two-day 200km sprint over
several mountain passes.</p>

<p>A good friend from Quito insisted Loja wasn’t particularly noteworthy, and if
I was going to sit in front of a computer for hours on end, I should do it in
a place with a view. So, 18 days ago I left Loja for the little village of
Vilcabamba (Sacred Valley).</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>View from my 'office' these past weeks. Photo by my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=243678582361736">Dan</a></p>
</div>

<p>She was right about the view.</p>

<p>The last two weeks I’ve been working hard; I put in over 50 hours this week. My
temporary residence has been the the gorgeous hostel of <a href="http://www.izhcayluma.de/">Izhcayluma</a>.
It is probably the best marketed hostel in all of Ecuador. Nearly everyone I’ve
met in Ecuador has recommended it. In addition to the steady stream of travelers making their way south or north
who stopover for a few days (or more) in Izhcayluma, people seem to come from
all over the world just to visit.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>Posing after arriving at Izhcayluma</p>
</div>

<p>While I’ve worked most of every day, invariably I took a break well past dark
to eat dinner and socialize with the current crop of guests. Three days seems
to be the time between turnovers, that is, the time after which I look up from
my computer, wipe the glaze off my eyes, and see all new faces.</p>

<p>I’ve met hundreds of people in my few weeks here, and, I would like to say, all
with interesting stories, but the truth is after the first week the stories all
start to sound the same. Though every couple days there is that one old man with great
tales of adventure from his youth or that young guy riding from Alaska to
Argentina on his motorcycle. I don’t mean to devalue anyone’s experiences, but
the unfortunate fact is <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html" title="The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride a bike">it has all been done before</a>.</p>

<p>People are interesting, every one of us, but among travelers travel
stories can be a bit repetitive. When faced with the inevitable hostel dinner
conversation (<em>“How long have you
been traveling? Wow! Where are you going? That’s cool. How much longer do you
have?”</em> etc.) I try to steer the conversation to something else: politics, pop
culture, technology, work, life, anything but travel.</p>

<p>That mini-rant out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I’ve met some awesome people and had great times. My ping pong game has seriously improved. As nice as Izhcayluma is (both in price and atmosphere)s, today I woke up with that itch. It’s time to move on.</p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow I leave for Peru.</strong></p>

<p>Well, I head in the direction of Peru. I suspect it will take me two days to
reach the border.</p>

<p>I’m taking the remote border crossing of Zumba - La Balsa, a remote and seldom
used crossing in the east of Ecuador/Peru. Remote and seldom used, because the
road is one-lane unpaved, dirt and gravel for hundreds of kilometers through
steep and windy mountain passes.</p>

<p><em>Why?!</em>, I ask myself,  am I taking the most difficult route into Peru? Well, there
are some legitimate reasons such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid the dirty, busy, and dangerous Pan Americana highway</li>
  <li>Avoid the central-northern part of Peru which is miles of tedious desert</li>
  <li>See some gorgeous vistas as I wind my way through the Andes</li>
</ul>

<p>But, ultimately, these are merely happy bonuses. The truth is that taking
the road less traveled on my definitely-not-a-mountain bike and spending weeks alone braving rain and muddy roads is exactly the sort of discomfort that makes for a good adventure. Maybe I have some underlying masochistic tendencies, though I prefer to frame it in the old adage <abbr title="Oh, god, how cliche of me">“<em>No Pain, No Gain</em>”</abbr>.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a bumpy ride.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> A tent on the road to Zumba, Ecuador</p>

<p>Today is the first leg of my journey to the Zumba/La Balsa border crossing with
Peru.</p>

<p>Left Vilcabamba late in the morning after a leisurely coffee (or two) and
a brief shopping expedition for food supplies. It is difficult to keep a high
caloric intake when biking 8-10 hours a day and the feeling of intense hunger
is very distracting, so taking the right snacks is important. Today in Vilcabmaba I was lucky to find all-natural
peanut butter (aka ground peanuts) and coconut oil, two high-protein and
high-calorie foods. I use bread as a hand-to-mouth food delivery device. For
dinner it will be tuna and mayonnaise.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-bxtftsD/0/M/6468093215b9e99afd53o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Taking a high-calorie snack break.</p>

<p>The road out of Vilcabamba was a steady incline that went through some intense
road construction. Apparently, a Chinese company is opening a mine in the area,
and they need to widen the roads to make room for the large dump trucks. The
road was very muddy and I got bogged down in about 300m of mud. It took about
30 minutes to drag my load to the dry dirt on the other side.</p>

<p>About 5km out of Vilcabamba the construction and dirty roads cleared up, and
I enjoyed smooth pavement for 10km more or so. The landscape consisted of
rolling hills covered in green and dotted with shrubs and short trees.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-w6Dx6kQ/0/M/6468082031387da839a0o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
The landscape about 15km outside of Vilcabamba, looking back on the route taken</p>

<p>At some point during the day I passed the little <em>pueblo</em> of Yangana. There
weren’t any open restaurants, so I just drove through. A kind man stopped me
and told me there weren’t any other villages for another 55km over two 
mountain passes. When I told him I wasn’t worried, I had a tent and food, he gave me that (unfortunately) familiar look that says <em>you’re-obviously-off-your-rocker-so-I’m-going-to-back-away-slowly-and-smile</em>. I thanked him for his advice and pedaled up the steep hill out of town.</p>

<p>Shortly after Yangana the pavement ended abruptly.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-HPNG6NC/0/M/6468141639dc5e900724o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Into the rough.</p>

<p>The beginning of the rough road corresponded with the beginning of the first
mountain pass. Several km in the pavement started
again as abruptly as it had ended, but only on one half of the two-lane road
(they’re working on surfacing the road).
Thankfully it lasted until the summit, where the road turned into a steep
downhill packed-dirt surface. I don’t expect to see smooth roads again until
Peru, some several hundred km ahead.</p>

<p>I hate carrying a watch. I deliberately don’t carry one when riding; it’s a little extra rebellion against civilization. The only times I need to know are “<em>Is it hungry time?</em>” and “<em>Is it sleeping time?</em>”</p>

<p>When I descended the first (small) pass and started up the next into Podocarpus
National Park, the sun was
racing towards the horizon. Looking at my personal watch, the lone hand was
pointing squarely between “sleeping-o-clock” and “hungry-o-clock”, also known
as “keep-going-thirty.” So, I kept going.</p>

<p>The road was single-laned, cliff-mountain road covered in loose dirt and large
loose rocks. In a few portions it was killer steep. Not the kind of terrain my
half-bald tires can get traction on. Pushed about 300m total here.</p>

<p>A little while later, my clock hand was cruising towards “sleeping-o-clock”, so
I began looking for a camping spot. The thing about mountain cliff roads, is
that, on one side you have a cliff wall, and on the other side you have a cliff
drop-off. No shoulder. Camping in the road was briefly on the table, but the
committee voted against that proposition; although, it was a close vote.</p>

<p>The fog was rolling in (seriously Andes, what’s with the fog at dusk? It’s like
a bad horror movie) when I found a small enclave off the side of the road near
the cliff. Enough space to hide my bicycle and tent. Done.</p>

<p>Only 45km (approx) today, felt like more. No rain. No mechanical problems.
Sweet camping spot.</p>

My tent in Parque Nacional Podocarpus near the cliff. Behind that fog is a gorgeous view of the valley and nearby mountains, of course I only took a picture of the fog.</p>

<p>Woke early. Slept soundly aside from a strange dream where my hidden camping
spot was invaded by dozens of gypsies traveling in covered wagons painted in
bright colors. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stepped into the dawn
I half wondered where the gypsies had gone.</p>

<p>Broke camp quickly, packed up my bike and headed back onto the steep rough
road. Not even 1km in I got my first flat. I’ve been using slime tubes, tubes
filled with a neon green slime that helps fills punctures. So, if I got a real
flat, then the puncture must be pretty large. Sure enough, I found a large
puncture, but it was quickly patched.</p>

Changing the first flat tire</p>

<p>A few km after the patch I was running low on water, having indulged in 3 cups
of coffee this morning. I stopped shortly to fill my bottle up from a small clear waterfall. The mountain water was clear and tasted fresh. I filtered it quickly, though later in the day I filled up twice more and didn’t filter. We’ll see if I get sick.</p>

Filling up on mountain water from a small waterfall</p>

<p>After 5 or 6 more km I peaked the pass, where I could see far into the horizon.
The descent that followed turned out to be more grueling than the ascent. My
bike is not a mountain bike, the biggest consequence of this means I do not
have shocks. Racing down rough dirt and rocky roads with plenty of switchbacks
is not comfortable. Just 30 minutes in my hands were starting to develop
blisters from my vice like grip on the brakes. By the end of the day my hands
hand blistered, popped, and re-blistered several times. The pain was so intense
I could barely hold on the the handlebars.</p>

The view before the bouncy and hand torturing descent</p>

<p>Passed through the small villages of Valladolid and Palanda. Stopped in Palanda
for a quick lunch and resupply (more tuna). Didn’t quite make it to Zumba,
despite the relatively easy and fast-going flat terrain in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Stopped in dusk at the tiny (less than 50 people) village of Progreso
20km before Zumba. There
were no restaurants, stores, or hostels, so I was going to ride out of town to
camp somewhere, but a kind local family fed me dinner and let me sleep in a spare bed. Apparently cyclists pass through that village often without stopping, and they were interested in my story.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Peru!</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> San Ignacio, Peru</p>

<p>What a day! Left early from Progreso after thanking the nice family profusely
and forcing them to take a few dollars compensation.
They let me fill up my three water bottles from their hose.
There is no real plumbing in these areas, so for water they harness a natural
spring and attach a hose to it.</p>

<p>As a final gesture of kindness they gave me some sweet sugar covered <em>empañadas</em> to snack on during the day. I didn’t tell them that bread carbs weren’t really my thing. Smile. Nod. <em>Gracias a ustedes, muy amable!</em></p>

<p>From Progreso it was about 10km to Zumba, but it was the next valley over,
which meant a 3ish hour climb on more bad roads. I still can’t believe this
entire southeast portion of Ecuador is without paved roads.</p>

<p>The climb was relatively easy. I listened to some podcasts I had downloaded in
Vilcabamba. Got mostly caught up on international and economic news.
Egypt is finally having their elections! Atrocious things are happening in
Syria, still.</p>

<p>Coasted into Zumba just before noon as rain started pouring. I camped out in an
Internet cafe for 30 minutes waiting for the rain to pass. It didn’t. Went to
a restaurant and ate a meal. Still raining. Around one PM I knew I needed
to get going if I wanted to make it to the border. Set out for the last 35km of
my Ecuadorian journey in a nasty downpour.</p>

<p>Five km from Zumba I got a flat. The road was covered in broken glass hidden
under wet mud. Patching a tube in the rain is… an experience. I was filthy
when finished, mud everywhere, soaking wet. Oh well, adventure right?</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7JdNWfD/0/M/64680950418e8a2a0d6co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Changing a flat in rain and mud. Why doesn’t it look so bad in this photo?</p>

<p>Five km later the same tire was flat again. The patch I had just applied wasn’t
working, apparently I need to practice my patching-in-the-rain skills. Screw it.
Ripped out the tube and put in a fresh spare. I’ll fix this one (if I can?)
later when I’m somewhere dry and warm.</p>

<p>Some indeterminate amount of time later the rain stopped and I was treated to
a colorful after-rain sky.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-wdVvq8Q/0/M/6468099847fbdf854ea2o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
After the rain</p>

<p>At some point a taxi passed me with a blonde-haired gringo hanging out the
window waving. It was an <a href="http://www.smilingaway.com">old Swedish friend</a> from Cuenca/Vilcabamba on his way to Peru as well.</p>

<p>More time passed. It is hard to believe I did less than 30 miles today, it took
almost all day.</p>

<p>Before officially crossing into Peru there is a tiny control point signifying
the end of Ecuador. They took my passport, did some stuff with it, asked me
some questions, and let me fill up my water bottles. Adios!</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7jkkZhC/0/M/6468121799ff1b1aa352o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
The tiny control point with two guards and my bike. Ecuador is back down that road.</p>

<p>The last several km from the control to the actual border was some of the worst
terrain of this trip so far. Horribly steep grades (both up and down) littered with potholes and rocks.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN#!i=2056101947&amp;k=gsgQjxd&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">border between Peru and
Ecuador</a> is a small river over which is built
a small bridge with the only pavement for hundreds of km on either side. The
descent down to the bridge is jarring and contains all the aforementioned features.</p>

<p>Hands hurting (more blisters) and legs tired, I rested on the Ecuadorian side to enjoy a last Pilsner (an Ecuadorian beer). It was warm, but what can you do?</p>

<p>This was the most laidback border crossing I’ve ever seen. No police. No
officials. After my beer I just rolled my bike over the bridge into Peru. From
that point I could have kept going, for there was no one to stop me, but
I figured it was prudent to search out someone to give me an entrance stamp.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-4pqfbCD/0/M/64681125975cde47e6feo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
30 feet of sweet pavement between Peru and Ecuador</p>

<p>The Peruvian migration officer is found in a little red building 50ft from the
bridge in an unlabeled room. He was sleeping on a cot behind his desk. I gave
him a friendly nudge. He awoke right away and happily began the paperwork. Many
questions were asked about my plans and my journey, and the exchange was going
well until he went to stamp my passport.</p>

<p>Frantically flipping through the pages of my passport he began demanding where
my <em>sello</em> was. <em>Sello</em>? No idea what this is. He became even more blustered
when I asked for an explanation. He held up a rubber stamp from his deck and
practically screamed <em>SELLO!!</em>. Oh. Where was my Ecuadorian exit stamp?
Somewhere in there, those two guards at the control (remember that?) had done
something with my passport, they must have stamped it.</p>

<p>It wasn’t there. I didn’t have an Ecuadorian exit stamp. The Peruvian migration official was convinced I was attempting to escape Ecuador illegally. In my most sincere and polite Spanish, I promised I wasn’t and I would go straight back to Ecuador and find that stamp. Cross my heart.</p>

<p>Turns out those two guards hadn’t given me a stamp, and they weren’t supposed
to. I have no idea what they did with my passport. Anyways, right on the
Ecuadorian side of the bridge was a migrations office where a policeman was
supposed to dole out these oh-so-important stamps. The office was empty. The
stamp was sitting right there on the desk… why.. I could just pick it up
and…Oh, did I ever consider it.</p>

<p>Resisting the urge to stamp myself into Ecuador, I asked a kid outside where I might find
the <em>Policia</em>. She pointed me towards the river, where I found 6 shirtless guys
playing an extremely intense and serious game of volleyball. Practically
shoving myself in the middle of the game, I politely inquired which of these
fine sweaty chaps had the authority to let me out of Ecuador. A tall, bronze
muscular one waved and made the universal hand sign motion for “<em>5 more minutes</em>.”</p>

<p>For 45 minutes I watched the game. Interesting to watch, yes,
but I was rather annoyed and ready to get leave Ecuador. Every couple serves the
policeman would say sorry and motion for 5 more minutes.</p>

<p>The game was fierce. Ecuadorians are serious about their volleyball. About
a dozen onlookers from the village had come to spectate. Finally it was over.
The policeman’s team had won. He was in a cheery mood as we walked to the
office. Dripping sweat all over the desk he handed me the stamp and
said I should do it myself so he doesn’t get sweat on my passport. Why, thanks
<em>señor</em>.</p>

<p>I stamped myself out of Ecuador and recrossed the bridge.</p>

<p>Now convinced I’m on the up and up, the same Peruvian officer readily stamps my
passport with a 180 day tourist visa.</p>

<p><strong>Hello Peru!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thus concludes my time in Ecuador. I really enjoyed my 8 months here. I highly
recommend it to anyone visiting South America. Feel free to ask me anything
about it in comments or email.</em></p>
