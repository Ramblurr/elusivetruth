<h1>Daily Travelogue</h1>
<p>While traveling, I do my best to write a few sentences a day in my little paper notebook. As I get access to the internet, I clean up some of these entries and post them here. Don't expect an update each day; I don't have Internet every day.</p>

<p>Where possible I just stick to the facts: <em>what, when, where</em>. If you want to know the <em>why</em>, head over to the less-frequently updated <a href="/articles.html">articles section</a> where I post long blobs of overengineered and annoyingly contemplative text.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cusco, Peru</p>

<p>Back in Cusco after a 12 day trip to the jungle town of Puerto Maldonado. Six
of those twelve days were spent cycling up over the Andes to their very edge
and then down their steep backside all the way to the jungle.</p>

<p>Fun Statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distance cycled:</strong> 490km / 305mi</li>
  <li><strong>Mountain passes crossed:</strong> 2</li>
  <li><strong>Highest point:</strong> 4,751 m / 15,587 ft<br />
(higher than any point in the lower 48 USA)</li>
  <li><strong>Lowest point:</strong> 0m / 0 ft</li>
  <li><strong>Oddest camping spot:</strong> <em>a graveyard</em> or <em>a rural school classroom</em> (tie)</li>
  <li><strong>Total crashes:</strong> 1</li>
  <li><strong>Total spent:</strong> $40</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first cycling trip with a partner. Despite my initial apprehension,
the trip went smashingly well. I wasn’t concerned about my friend’s physical
fitness, she’s in great physical shape and has the steely willpower of
a warrior. Rather, I was uneasy that the sanctity of solo travel, as I’ve been
practicing for months now, would be marred by the presence of another.</p>

<p>In the end, my fears were unfounded, in no small part because my partner
possesses that essential travel mojo that makes for the best traveling buddies.</p>

<p>You know these people, they’re relaxed, open-minded, and aren’t afraid to
compromise on the little stuff. They’re also strong, independent, and
can take care of themselves. Most importantly perhaps, they keep their heads
about them when shit goes down. And, boy, did shit go down this trip.</p>

<p>Meet Bronwyn!</p>
</div>

<p>It is the morning of third day. Ahead of us is the final and highest pass in
our journey out of the Andes. Only 4,000 vertical feet stand between us and the
promised glorious downhill plunge into the jungle. Beginning outside the small
town of Ocangate, we amble along pleasantly through the valley, breakfast still
settling in our stomachs. The mood is high.</p>

<p>After a short time, the human influence on the land begins to fade away. The
fences penning the llama herds end, and the little scratches in the ground that
mark cultivated land peter out. The road changes as well; the gentle incline
has turned upward sharply. We are headed out of the valley.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>The rough and rugged landscape of the Andes far above the timber line.</p>
</div>

<p>Once the road turns up, Bron and I’s chatter abruptly stops. We pause once more
to adjust our MP3 players, both choosing suitable auditory motivation.  My
choice is electronic music with a heavy, steady, and relentless beat. We each
settle into our own private place and push off towards the apex.</p>

<div class="caption">
<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM#!i=2056104369&amp;k=dv3HKp6&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A" title="Up and Around"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-dv3HKp6/0/M/693162876279ac7fba74o-M.jpg" title="Up and Around" alt="Up and Around" /></a>
<p>The curve where the steep incline more or less began</p>
</div>

<p>A mountain is something you must climb alone. You might be accompanied by
others, but they don’t climb the mountain for you. Only you can bring yourself
to keep those pedals turning and your grip firm on the bars. The correct state
of mind takes you farther than physical prowess ever will. Pounding bass in
your ear to urge you forward doesn’t hurt either.</p>

<p>We continue in silence and at our own pace for several hours, stopping every
few kilometers to sync up. Each bend in the road reveals more incline. It’s around
midday now and the weather is taking a turn. Dark ominous clouds roil overhead. We
turn one corner to see the road ahead disappear into a thick white wall of fog.
The temperature plummets.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-nj8TDf6/0/M/69314590887586027ef5o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
It’s cold at wet at the top of the world.</p>

<p>We press forward into the fog. A light frigid rain begins to spatter our coats.
Before long the rain transforms into a wet heavy sleet that smacks into your
face and melts, flooding down your neck as an unpleasant stream of frosty
water.  Unconsciously, we drift closer to each other, matching our paces. Who
wants to be alone in the dark chilly wetness in the middle-of-nowhere at the
top of everything?</p>

<p>We’re not immune to the altitude. This high, oxygen is hard to come by.  The
instant you stop for breath, the icy bite you’ve been keeping at bay with
determined pedaling returns with a vengeance. You’re cold so you pedal faster,
which works for a short time, but you can’t sustain it at this altitude. Tired,
you stop to rest. A cunning trap.</p>

<p>At one point we pass three young children on the side of the road. We are miles
from anywhere, in horrible weather, and these children are walking down the
road as if coming home from school. The children (and their bloody mean dog)
stop and sit on the curb some 20 feet away and watch us attempting, rather
undextrously,  to peel a little mandarin orange. After we greedily snarf it
down (lunch-time had long since past and we’re running low on energy) I’m about
to start on our second one when I feel a twinge of guilt. Not seeing any orange
trees in the immediate proximity, I figure a sweet orange would be a nice
treat. After all, we will get out of this freezing situation and find more
oranges. I can’t say the same for them.</p>

<p>I scuttle over and hand one of them the orange, attempting to make small talk
in Spanish and Quechua. They say nothing. I stare at them for a moment. An
eerie emptiness stares back. Then their dog goes utter apeshit.</p>

<p>Scrambling back onto my bike, we push off into the headwind, heads down,
pedaling furiously to outrun the dog berserking at our heels.  I toss
a glance over my head as we round a bend, the kids are still sitting there,
orange in hand, expressionless.</p>

<p>Several curves later we stumble across the sign indicating we’ve reached the summit.
Cold. Stark. Unassuming. We made it.</p>

<div class="caption">

foggy." /></a>
<p>Triumph!</p>
</div>

<p>And so passed the first challenge of the trip, or so we thought. Coming up
soon, more cold, piercing winds, scorching heat, and lots of blood (and
a little screaming).</p>

<p>My slow, plodding bicycle journey so far. Green is on bike, red by bus.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s been almost two months since I parked by bike in Cusco, <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily.html">got an
apartment</a> and started
<a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/02/08/daily.html">studying Quechua</a>. Never did
I consider my biking journey through South America over, just temporarily on
hiatus. The culture, language, sights, and people of Cusco were just too enthralling to pass up. Not to mention I needed to get some serious work done.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I’m happy in Cusco, that I’m happy with my friends, and
that I’m happy studying Quechua, <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html">the
itch</a> has been
gnawing at the back of my mind.  My bike
has been giving those depressing looks every morning
like a dog who hasn’t been walked in months. The road has been calling my name,  that wide black road that snakes up
the mountain side out of Cusco before dropping into the Sacred Valley following
the raging Urubamba River passing hundreds of years of Inca history in the
process.</p>

<p>It’s time to take a vacation from Cusco. Next week is <em>Semana Santa</em> (Easter
Week). Some friends and I are going to visit the jungle near the small town of
Puerto Maldonado some 500km from Cusco. Two of us are going to bike there.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the two of us leave for our 5 to 6 day journey. My sketchy map claims
we face two large passes 4100m (13,400 ft) and 4900m (16,000ft) in height
before the long gentle descent into the jungle at near sea level (180m/600ft).
The route is marked on the map above in purple.</p>

<p>The road leading from the Andes around Cusco to the jungle has historically
been a terrible and difficult, with the Lonely Planet describing it as “vile”
and “requir[ing] hardiness” (and that’s traveling by bus!). Since that
publication, however, the road is said to have been fully smoothed and paved.
They even gave it a fancy name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoceanic_Highway">Interoceanic
Highway</a>. Usually I take
judgements about road conditions from locals with a grain of salt, but this
fellow has crossed the expanse in motorcycle 9 times. Though he thinks were
crazy to tackle those two passes on bike. He’s probably not wrong.</p>

<p>It’s frightening how quickly I fall back into routine once I stop
moving. I’m not opposed to routines out of principal, on the contrary,
routines are comforting in their familiarity. They provide discipline and
structure which allows us to establish ~~good~~ habits.</p>

<p>As an example, I find that when I’m constantly on the move, I let certain good habits
lapse: studying my languages, reading of news, communicating with my family.
However, I also pick up good habits that I find hard to maintain when
stationary: eating healthy, exercising, every day.</p>

<p>That said, whenever I find myself in a routine, I grow wary and suspicious.
The warm snug familiarity of routine inevitable leads to thoughtless complacency, which
leads to boredom and missed opportunity. Life needs stimulus to stave off the
mundane.</p>

<p>For now, though, the routine is welcome.</p>

<p>Last week I embarked on my quest to study the Native (South) American language of Quechua (<em>kech-wa</em>), the linga franca of the ancient Inca Empire. My daily routine
consists of consulting work, studying Quechua, and taking Quechua lessons.
Between those three, I theoretically should have little time to socialize,
yet, I’ve met many friendly and interesting people, mostly fellow
<em>gringos</em>, but several locals as well.</p>

<p>I’m still searching for a Peruvian near my own age with which to practice Quechua.
There are plenty of people here in Cuzco who speak Quechua, though most are older men
and women whom I speak with in taxis or in the markets.  My difficulties in finding
a younger conversation partner has inspired me to write an article about Quechua
and the difficulties it faces today. The unfortunate fact is that Quechua is a dying language. I will discuss the reasons for this and attempts to save it in this article, which
I will post soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime here is a long and boring video of my ride through downtown
Cuzco to the hostel I lived at for one week before moving to my apartment.
You can see the gorgeous Plaza de Armas, as well as the cute narrow little
streets.</p>

                    <p><em>The thrill of the unknown</em>, that is, perhaps, for me, the essence of travel.</p>

<p>To follow an open road that beckons with a sweet sultry strangeness into the
immense horizon, then to find yourself on the other end of that road in a novel
town, wheeling over the choppy cobblestone that you should appreciate as well-preserved colonial ambiance, yet can’t help but loathe as your teeth and sanity chatter out of your skull, ambling down street after street in this unknown place looking for an unknown destination where you can strip off those clothes encrusted in white layers of dried sweat, one layer for each day since your last icy cold shower like anthropomorphized tree rings, all the while dodging llama toting natives, creaky hand carts piled to the heavens with fresh colorful vegetables that put the surgically sorted shrink-wrapped cartons of genetically engineered greens and reds from your homeland to shame, and, don’t forget, the <em>put-put</em>-ing mototaxis that swarm around you in a choking cloud of black exhaust like metal bees from some Industrial Revolution era experiment gone horribly wrong; to lose yourself in this otherness, in this now-ness, with no intentions other than to keep moving, this is the essence of travel.</p>

<p>However, there is a certain comfort in <em>the known</em>.</p>

<p>For example, one can’t deny the mundane pleasure that comes from seeing familiar
faces, such as the little old lady’s craggy face that is split by a large
broken-toothed smile, as you approach in the neighborhood market to buy your three dollars of weekly produce. You’re no longer just another well off <em>gringo</em>, emissary from the land of iPads and flip-flops, but you have a name and a small loyalty, for a time at least.</p>

<p>Moreover, the comfort derived from a reliably hot (if not reliably flowing) shower and a familiar bed cannot be overstated.</p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as
you do not stop.</p><p>&#8212;Confucius</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m slowing down for a stretch in Cuzco, Peru. This involves breaking my minimalist
tradition and obtaining a few things: an apartment, roommates, and a real
towel. But I’m not calling Cuzco home, rather I’m temporarily taking advantage of the
location to indulge another hobby of mine: language learning. This week
I started studying Quechua, the native language of the Incas and second
official language of Peru.</p>

<p>Off the bike saddle and into the classroom. I can’t help but wonder how long it will be before the road, that irresistible temptress, seduces me back.</p>

                    <p><strong>From: Huaraz, Peru</strong></p>

<p>It is 2012. Over a month has passed since my last entry, though don’t mistake
the silence for inactivity. Quite a bit happened
the past month.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the border, my hands were a blistery mess secreting a vile
pus, thanks to the rough dirt roads and my lack of an adequate front
suspension. As much as I wanted to continue on by bike, the sharp gut-wrenching
pain radiating from my palms precluded any attempt to secure a strong grip on
the handlebars. Instead, I attached myself, my bike, and 4 bags to a group of
three swell Germans who arrived by bus. The next two weeks were spent in
their convivial company traveling around Northern Peru.</p>

<p>Too lazy to go into detail about the following period, though I’ll do the math
for you: in those 4 weeks of December I cycled a mere 3 days. For all my
diligent stalkers out there here was my route.</p>

<ul>
  <li>La Balsa (border) to Chachapoyas (collectivo)</li>
  <li>Chachapoyas to Leymebamba (bike, 1 day, 80km)</li>
  <li>Leymebamba to Cajamarca (bus)</li>
  <li>Cajamarca to Trujillo (bike, 2 days, 285km)</li>
  <li>Trujillo to Lima (bus)</li>
  <li>Lima to Trujillo (bus)</li>
</ul>

<p>While I still scribbled a bit in my journal every couple days, every time
I attempted to muster up the motivation to write more I found
a convenient distraction. Often, the process of putting to paper coherent and connected
sentences from the turbulent nebula of my thoughts resembles an undesired chore.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-QMH9D73/0/M/6714703861c450baedb6o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Winding slowly down the mountains outside Cajamarca. The road snakes off into the distance towards the desert.</p>

<p>The two day, 285km bike ride from Cajamarca in the Andes to Trujillo on the
 coast was gorgeous. Starting at 8,900 ft
 (2,700m) you climb over 2,400ft (750m) before starting the long windy descent
 towards the coast. The scenery gradually changes from mountain scrub to desolate desert.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-V2XpjRV/0/M/671469864199965d989bo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Fixing a flat in the hot barren desert.</p>

<p>In Trujillo I stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas, a place famous among everyone
 whose cycled in South America. Lucho, a retired racing cyclist, has been
 opening his house to traveling cyclists for over 25 years. He provides a bed,
 shower, and great company for as along as you want, <strong>for free</strong>. I took
 advantage of his hospitality for a week and spent the New Years with Lucho and
 his family.</p>

The House of Cyclists</p>

<p>The morning after arriving in Trujillo I hopped on a bus for the 10 hour
journey to Lima to visit a good ‘ol friend from Ecuador who was heading back
to the USA with her tail between her legs. Guess she couldn’t handle the
awesomeness that was Peru.</p>

<p>Christmas in Lima. Bus back to Trujillo. Stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas. New
Years in Trujillo. Hello 2012.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> San Ignacio, Peru</p>

<p>What a day! Left early from Progreso after thanking the nice family profusely
and forcing them to take a few dollars compensation.
They let me fill up my three water bottles from their hose.
There is no real plumbing in these areas, so for water they harness a natural
spring and attach a hose to it.</p>

<p>As a final gesture of kindness they gave me some sweet sugar covered <em>empañadas</em> to snack on during the day. I didn’t tell them that bread carbs weren’t really my thing. Smile. Nod. <em>Gracias a ustedes, muy amable!</em></p>

<p>From Progreso it was about 10km to Zumba, but it was the next valley over,
which meant a 3ish hour climb on more bad roads. I still can’t believe this
entire southeast portion of Ecuador is without paved roads.</p>

<p>The climb was relatively easy. I listened to some podcasts I had downloaded in
Vilcabamba. Got mostly caught up on international and economic news.
Egypt is finally having their elections! Atrocious things are happening in
Syria, still.</p>

<p>Coasted into Zumba just before noon as rain started pouring. I camped out in an
Internet cafe for 30 minutes waiting for the rain to pass. It didn’t. Went to
a restaurant and ate a meal. Still raining. Around one PM I knew I needed
to get going if I wanted to make it to the border. Set out for the last 35km of
my Ecuadorian journey in a nasty downpour.</p>

<p>Five km from Zumba I got a flat. The road was covered in broken glass hidden
under wet mud. Patching a tube in the rain is… an experience. I was filthy
when finished, mud everywhere, soaking wet. Oh well, adventure right?</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7JdNWfD/0/M/64680950418e8a2a0d6co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Changing a flat in rain and mud. Why doesn’t it look so bad in this photo?</p>

<p>Five km later the same tire was flat again. The patch I had just applied wasn’t
working, apparently I need to practice my patching-in-the-rain skills. Screw it.
Ripped out the tube and put in a fresh spare. I’ll fix this one (if I can?)
later when I’m somewhere dry and warm.</p>

<p>Some indeterminate amount of time later the rain stopped and I was treated to
a colorful after-rain sky.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-wdVvq8Q/0/M/6468099847fbdf854ea2o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
After the rain</p>

<p>At some point a taxi passed me with a blonde-haired gringo hanging out the
window waving. It was an <a href="http://www.smilingaway.com">old Swedish friend</a> from Cuenca/Vilcabamba on his way to Peru as well.</p>

<p>More time passed. It is hard to believe I did less than 30 miles today, it took
almost all day.</p>

<p>Before officially crossing into Peru there is a tiny control point signifying
the end of Ecuador. They took my passport, did some stuff with it, asked me
some questions, and let me fill up my water bottles. Adios!</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7jkkZhC/0/M/6468121799ff1b1aa352o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
The tiny control point with two guards and my bike. Ecuador is back down that road.</p>

<p>The last several km from the control to the actual border was some of the worst
terrain of this trip so far. Horribly steep grades (both up and down) littered with potholes and rocks.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN#!i=2056101947&amp;k=gsgQjxd&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">border between Peru and
Ecuador</a> is a small river over which is built
a small bridge with the only pavement for hundreds of km on either side. The
descent down to the bridge is jarring and contains all the aforementioned features.</p>

<p>Hands hurting (more blisters) and legs tired, I rested on the Ecuadorian side to enjoy a last Pilsner (an Ecuadorian beer). It was warm, but what can you do?</p>

<p>This was the most laidback border crossing I’ve ever seen. No police. No
officials. After my beer I just rolled my bike over the bridge into Peru. From
that point I could have kept going, for there was no one to stop me, but
I figured it was prudent to search out someone to give me an entrance stamp.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-4pqfbCD/0/M/64681125975cde47e6feo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
30 feet of sweet pavement between Peru and Ecuador</p>

<p>The Peruvian migration officer is found in a little red building 50ft from the
bridge in an unlabeled room. He was sleeping on a cot behind his desk. I gave
him a friendly nudge. He awoke right away and happily began the paperwork. Many
questions were asked about my plans and my journey, and the exchange was going
well until he went to stamp my passport.</p>

<p>Frantically flipping through the pages of my passport he began demanding where
my <em>sello</em> was. <em>Sello</em>? No idea what this is. He became even more blustered
when I asked for an explanation. He held up a rubber stamp from his deck and
practically screamed <em>SELLO!!</em>. Oh. Where was my Ecuadorian exit stamp?
Somewhere in there, those two guards at the control (remember that?) had done
something with my passport, they must have stamped it.</p>

<p>It wasn’t there. I didn’t have an Ecuadorian exit stamp. The Peruvian migration official was convinced I was attempting to escape Ecuador illegally. In my most sincere and polite Spanish, I promised I wasn’t and I would go straight back to Ecuador and find that stamp. Cross my heart.</p>

<p>Turns out those two guards hadn’t given me a stamp, and they weren’t supposed
to. I have no idea what they did with my passport. Anyways, right on the
Ecuadorian side of the bridge was a migrations office where a policeman was
supposed to dole out these oh-so-important stamps. The office was empty. The
stamp was sitting right there on the desk… why.. I could just pick it up
and…Oh, did I ever consider it.</p>

<p>Resisting the urge to stamp myself into Ecuador, I asked a kid outside where I might find
the <em>Policia</em>. She pointed me towards the river, where I found 6 shirtless guys
playing an extremely intense and serious game of volleyball. Practically
shoving myself in the middle of the game, I politely inquired which of these
fine sweaty chaps had the authority to let me out of Ecuador. A tall, bronze
muscular one waved and made the universal hand sign motion for “<em>5 more minutes</em>.”</p>

<p>For 45 minutes I watched the game. Interesting to watch, yes,
but I was rather annoyed and ready to get leave Ecuador. Every couple serves the
policeman would say sorry and motion for 5 more minutes.</p>

<p>The game was fierce. Ecuadorians are serious about their volleyball. About
a dozen onlookers from the village had come to spectate. Finally it was over.
The policeman’s team had won. He was in a cheery mood as we walked to the
office. Dripping sweat all over the desk he handed me the stamp and
said I should do it myself so he doesn’t get sweat on my passport. Why, thanks
<em>señor</em>.</p>

<p>I stamped myself out of Ecuador and recrossed the bridge.</p>

<p>Now convinced I’m on the up and up, the same Peruvian officer readily stamps my
passport with a 180 day tourist visa.</p>

<p><strong>Hello Peru!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thus concludes my time in Ecuador. I really enjoyed my 8 months here. I highly
recommend it to anyone visiting South America. Feel free to ask me anything
about it in comments or email.</em></p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Progreso, Ecuador</p>

<p>Woke early. Slept soundly aside from a strange dream where my hidden camping
spot was invaded by dozens of gypsies traveling in covered wagons painted in
bright colors. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stepped into the dawn
I half wondered where the gypsies had gone.</p>

<p>Broke camp quickly, packed up my bike and headed back onto the steep rough
road. Not even 1km in I got my first flat. I’ve been using slime tubes, tubes
filled with a neon green slime that helps fills punctures. So, if I got a real
flat, then the puncture must be pretty large. Sure enough, I found a large
puncture, but it was quickly patched.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-K8Z9BCg/0/M/646808342564414dbf96o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Changing the first flat tire</p>

<p>A few km after the patch I was running low on water, having indulged in 3 cups
of coffee this morning. I stopped shortly to fill my bottle up from a small clear waterfall. The mountain water was clear and tasted fresh. I filtered it quickly, though later in the day I filled up twice more and didn’t filter. We’ll see if I get sick.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-gk99LFC/0/M/646810569309dd78358bo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Filling up on mountain water from a small waterfall</p>

<p>After 5 or 6 more km I peaked the pass, where I could see far into the horizon.
The descent that followed turned out to be more grueling than the ascent. My
bike is not a mountain bike, the biggest consequence of this means I do not
have shocks. Racing down rough dirt and rocky roads with plenty of switchbacks
is not comfortable. Just 30 minutes in my hands were starting to develop
blisters from my vice like grip on the brakes. By the end of the day my hands
hand blistered, popped, and re-blistered several times. The pain was so intense
I could barely hold on the the handlebars.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-JSC4hkp/0/M/6468096427a1bdb185beo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
The view before the bouncy and hand torturing descent</p>

<p>Passed through the small villages of Valladolid and Palanda. Stopped in Palanda
for a quick lunch and resupply (more tuna). Didn’t quite make it to Zumba,
despite the relatively easy and fast-going flat terrain in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Stopped in dusk at the tiny (less than 50 people) village of Progreso
20km before Zumba. There
were no restaurants, stores, or hostels, so I was going to ride out of town to
camp somewhere, but a kind local family fed me dinner and let me sleep in a spare bed. Apparently cyclists pass through that village often without stopping, and they were interested in my story.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Peru!</p>

                       <p>I'm Casey, a nomad and a programmer. I value radical
                       autonomy and material minimalism. I'm allergic to
                       cubicles and cats.</p>

                       <p> This is my travel chronicle.</p>
