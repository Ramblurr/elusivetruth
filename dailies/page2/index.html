<h1>Daily Travelogue</h1>
<p>While traveling, I do my best to write a few sentences a day in my little paper notebook. As I get access to the internet, I clean up some of these entries and post them here. Don't expect an update each day; I don't have Internet every day.</p>

<p>Where possible I just stick to the facts: <em>what, when, where</em>. If you want to know the <em>why</em>, head over to the less-frequently updated <a href="/articles.html">articles section</a> where I post long blobs of overengineered and annoyingly contemplative text.</p>

                    <p>My <a href="http://binaryelysium.com/quechua/">Quechua language study project</a> was abruptly cut short in May when
a fantastic job opportunity presented itself. I abruptly packed up my little
life in Cusco and headed north to the USA for the summer.</p>

<p>While I’ve no regrets about leaving South America, I’ve left some loose ends
down there. First, I had a personal goal of crossing the continent on my bike,
but I only completed, perhaps, 25% before getting distracted by the Quechua
language and great friends in Cusco.</p>

<p>Second, during the course of my Quechua study I started <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/04/20/daily.html">a project to document
stories</a> with recordings and transcripts online. I’ve tons of recorded
material to process and upload.</p>

<p>I’m not done with South America or Quechua. I’m comfortable with lettings
experiences come and, but this isn’t one of them. One of these days I’ll finish my
cycling tour, and continue my study of the language.</p>

<p>Since my return stateside I’ve been visiting a bit of the USA. Kayaking in
Alaska, cycling in Colorado, and consulting work all over the country.</p>

<p>Having refilled the coffers, so to speak, I’ll be headed back to Egypt in a few
weeks to brush up on my Arabic before beginning a Middle Eastern bike tour.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cusco, Peru</p>

<p>An Andean Condor in flight (Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nospuds/381170650/">Phil Robinson</a>)
</p>
</div>

<p>Working on a new project to record and release online native Quechua stories,
myths, parables, jokes, proverbs, etc. I released the first one yesterday. It
is a short story about a condor and his girl. You can listen to it and read
along in Quechua: <a href="http://binaryelysium.com/quechua/audio/stories/kundur.html">Kundur (The Condor)</a>. English and Spanish
translations will be up soon.</p>

<p>People often decry the fact that Quechua is in decline, that tales and
traditions are being lost, as fewer and fewer children grow up speaking
Quechua.  By recording and making them available online, I feel that I’m doing
my small part to help preserve Quechua and its unique story.</p>

<p>Though, in some contradictory way, I feel that, by recording and transcribing
stories, I’m also contributing to the decline of Quechua.</p>

<p><em>(For reference, the kinds of stories I’m referring to are tales, parables,
children’s stories, myths, etc.)</em></p>

<p>This strange thought occurred to me while editing a beautiful story, told from
memory by a young woman, who had many stories she couldn’t wait to tell me.
I realized I couldn’t think of any stories or myths from my culture. That
struck me as absurd. Surely, we have stories and myths? I mean,
I remember hearing them when I was a kid. Where did they all go?</p>

<p>Of course we have stories and myths (think Aesop’s fables and Grimm’s Fairy
Tales), but they’re all stuck in books. We invented writing and books, so our
shared cultural stories can’t ever be ‘lost’…right?</p>

<p>Well, yes, technically, with books–and now digitization–most of our cherished
stories from childhood won’t ever be lost. After all, that’s the problem of the
Quechua people today: they didn’t invent writing, and now they’re culture is
endanger of vanishing out from under us. It’s a mad dash to scribble down as
much history and culture as we can before the Westernization of their identity
is complete.</p>

<!--- We can't possibly capture an entire history and culture ??  -->

<p>Yet, even as their stories are disappearing, they are still very much alive.
They are living, breathing, animated creatures, that change slightly every time
they’re told. They make their home in the heads of grandparents and their
grandchildren. What a fascinating life these stories have, not restricted by
their ‘canonical’ copies in some dusty tome, free to evolve and change.</p>

<p>Our stories are fixed in books, like beautiful vibrant butterflies pinned to
the pages of a child’s insect collection. Their colors have faded and they’ve
become crispy in our hands. Our stories have ‘right’ versions. Don’t dare
deviate from them or you’ll be ‘wrong’.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s the price of preserving our stories. To save our stories we nail
them to the pages of books, where they become stationary and stagnant.</p>

<p><strong>Dead stories are better than no stories, I suppose.</strong></p>

<p>And with that in mind, I do my best capturing the stories of the Quechua,
pinning them to paper and hoping that in the process I’m not wringing too much life out of them.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Cusco, Peru</p>

<p>Back in Cusco after a 12 day trip to the jungle town of Puerto Maldonado. Six
of those twelve days were spent cycling up over the Andes to their very edge
and then down their steep backside all the way to the jungle.</p>

<p>Fun Statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distance cycled:</strong> 490km / 305mi</li>
  <li><strong>Mountain passes crossed:</strong> 2</li>
  <li><strong>Highest point:</strong> 4,751 m / 15,587 ft<br />
(higher than any point in the lower 48 USA)</li>
  <li><strong>Lowest point:</strong> 0m / 0 ft</li>
  <li><strong>Oddest camping spot:</strong> <em>a graveyard</em> or <em>a rural school classroom</em> (tie)</li>
  <li><strong>Total crashes:</strong> 1</li>
  <li><strong>Total spent:</strong> $40</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first cycling trip with a partner. Despite my initial apprehension,
the trip went smashingly well. I wasn’t concerned about my friend’s physical
fitness, she’s in great physical shape and has the steely willpower of
a warrior. Rather, I was uneasy that the sanctity of solo travel, as I’ve been
practicing for months now, would be marred by the presence of another.</p>

<p>In the end, my fears were unfounded, in no small part because my partner
possesses that essential travel mojo that makes for the best traveling buddies.</p>

<p>You know these people, they’re relaxed, open-minded, and aren’t afraid to
compromise on the little stuff. They’re also strong, independent, and
can take care of themselves. Most importantly perhaps, they keep their heads
about them when shit goes down. And, boy, did shit go down this trip.</p>

<p>Meet Bronwyn!</p>
</div>

<p>It is the morning of third day. Ahead of us is the final and highest pass in
our journey out of the Andes. Only 4,000 vertical feet stand between us and the
promised glorious downhill plunge into the jungle. Beginning outside the small
town of Ocangate, we amble along pleasantly through the valley, breakfast still
settling in our stomachs. The mood is high.</p>

<p>After a short time, the human influence on the land begins to fade away. The
fences penning the llama herds end, and the little scratches in the ground that
mark cultivated land peter out. The road changes as well; the gentle incline
has turned upward sharply. We are headed out of the valley.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>The rough and rugged landscape of the Andes far above the timber line.</p>
</div>

<p>Once the road turns up, Bron and I’s chatter abruptly stops. We pause once more
to adjust our MP3 players, both choosing suitable auditory motivation.  My
choice is electronic music with a heavy, steady, and relentless beat. We each
settle into our own private place and push off towards the apex.</p>

<div class="caption">
<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM#!i=2056104369&amp;k=dv3HKp6&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A" title="Up and Around"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-dv3HKp6/0/M/693162876279ac7fba74o-M.jpg" title="Up and Around" alt="Up and Around" /></a>
<p>The curve where the steep incline more or less began</p>
</div>

<p>A mountain is something you must climb alone. You might be accompanied by
others, but they don’t climb the mountain for you. Only you can bring yourself
to keep those pedals turning and your grip firm on the bars. The correct state
of mind takes you farther than physical prowess ever will. Pounding bass in
your ear to urge you forward doesn’t hurt either.</p>

<p>We continue in silence and at our own pace for several hours, stopping every
few kilometers to sync up. Each bend in the road reveals more incline. It’s around
midday now and the weather is taking a turn. Dark ominous clouds roil overhead. We
turn one corner to see the road ahead disappear into a thick white wall of fog.
The temperature plummets.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-nj8TDf6/0/M/69314590887586027ef5o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
It’s cold at wet at the top of the world.</p>

<p>We press forward into the fog. A light frigid rain begins to spatter our coats.
Before long the rain transforms into a wet heavy sleet that smacks into your
face and melts, flooding down your neck as an unpleasant stream of frosty
water.  Unconsciously, we drift closer to each other, matching our paces. Who
wants to be alone in the dark chilly wetness in the middle-of-nowhere at the
top of everything?</p>

<p>We’re not immune to the altitude. This high, oxygen is hard to come by.  The
instant you stop for breath, the icy bite you’ve been keeping at bay with
determined pedaling returns with a vengeance. You’re cold so you pedal faster,
which works for a short time, but you can’t sustain it at this altitude. Tired,
you stop to rest. A cunning trap.</p>

<p>At one point we pass three young children on the side of the road. We are miles
from anywhere, in horrible weather, and these children are walking down the
road as if coming home from school. The children (and their bloody mean dog)
stop and sit on the curb some 20 feet away and watch us attempting, rather
undextrously,  to peel a little mandarin orange. After we greedily snarf it
down (lunch-time had long since past and we’re running low on energy) I’m about
to start on our second one when I feel a twinge of guilt. Not seeing any orange
trees in the immediate proximity, I figure a sweet orange would be a nice
treat. After all, we will get out of this freezing situation and find more
oranges. I can’t say the same for them.</p>

<p>I scuttle over and hand one of them the orange, attempting to make small talk
in Spanish and Quechua. They say nothing. I stare at them for a moment. An
eerie emptiness stares back. Then their dog goes utter apeshit.</p>

<p>Scrambling back onto my bike, we push off into the headwind, heads down,
pedaling furiously to outrun the dog berserking at our heels.  I toss
a glance over my head as we round a bend, the kids are still sitting there,
orange in hand, expressionless.</p>

<p>Several curves later we stumble across the sign indicating we’ve reached the summit.
Cold. Stark. Unassuming. We made it.</p>

<p>Triumph!</p>
</div>

<p>And so passed the first challenge of the trip, or so we thought. Coming up
soon, more cold, piercing winds, scorching heat, and lots of blood (and
a little screaming).</p>

<p>My slow, plodding bicycle journey so far. Green is on bike, red by bus.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s been almost two months since I parked by bike in Cusco, <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily.html">got an
apartment</a> and started
<a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/02/08/daily.html">studying Quechua</a>. Never did
I consider my biking journey through South America over, just temporarily on
hiatus. The culture, language, sights, and people of Cusco were just too enthralling to pass up. Not to mention I needed to get some serious work done.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I’m happy in Cusco, that I’m happy with my friends, and
that I’m happy studying Quechua, <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html">the
itch</a> has been
gnawing at the back of my mind.  My bike
has been giving those depressing looks every morning
like a dog who hasn’t been walked in months. The road has been calling my name,  that wide black road that snakes up
the mountain side out of Cusco before dropping into the Sacred Valley following
the raging Urubamba River passing hundreds of years of Inca history in the
process.</p>

<p>It’s time to take a vacation from Cusco. Next week is <em>Semana Santa</em> (Easter
Week). Some friends and I are going to visit the jungle near the small town of
Puerto Maldonado some 500km from Cusco. Two of us are going to bike there.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the two of us leave for our 5 to 6 day journey. My sketchy map claims
we face two large passes 4100m (13,400 ft) and 4900m (16,000ft) in height
before the long gentle descent into the jungle at near sea level (180m/600ft).
The route is marked on the map above in purple.</p>

<p>The road leading from the Andes around Cusco to the jungle has historically
been a terrible and difficult, with the Lonely Planet describing it as “vile”
and “requir[ing] hardiness” (and that’s traveling by bus!). Since that
publication, however, the road is said to have been fully smoothed and paved.
They even gave it a fancy name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoceanic_Highway">Interoceanic
Highway</a>. Usually I take
judgements about road conditions from locals with a grain of salt, but this
fellow has crossed the expanse in motorcycle 9 times. Though he thinks were
crazy to tackle those two passes on bike. He’s probably not wrong.</p>

<p>It’s frightening how quickly I fall back into routine once I stop
moving. I’m not opposed to routines out of principal, on the contrary,
routines are comforting in their familiarity. They provide discipline and
structure which allows us to establish ~~good~~ habits.</p>

<p>As an example, I find that when I’m constantly on the move, I let certain good habits
lapse: studying my languages, reading of news, communicating with my family.
However, I also pick up good habits that I find hard to maintain when
stationary: eating healthy, exercising, every day.</p>

<p>That said, whenever I find myself in a routine, I grow wary and suspicious.
The warm snug familiarity of routine inevitable leads to thoughtless complacency, which
leads to boredom and missed opportunity. Life needs stimulus to stave off the
mundane.</p>

<p>For now, though, the routine is welcome.</p>

<p>Last week I embarked on my quest to study the Native (South) American language of Quechua (<em>kech-wa</em>), the linga franca of the ancient Inca Empire. My daily routine
consists of consulting work, studying Quechua, and taking Quechua lessons.
Between those three, I theoretically should have little time to socialize,
yet, I’ve met many friendly and interesting people, mostly fellow
<em>gringos</em>, but several locals as well.</p>

<p>I’m still searching for a Peruvian near my own age with which to practice Quechua.
There are plenty of people here in Cuzco who speak Quechua, though most are older men
and women whom I speak with in taxis or in the markets.  My difficulties in finding
a younger conversation partner has inspired me to write an article about Quechua
and the difficulties it faces today. The unfortunate fact is that Quechua is a dying language. I will discuss the reasons for this and attempts to save it in this article, which
I will post soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime here is a long and boring video of my ride through downtown
Cuzco to the hostel I lived at for one week before moving to my apartment.
You can see the gorgeous Plaza de Armas, as well as the cute narrow little
streets.</p>

                    <p><em>The thrill of the unknown</em>, that is, perhaps, for me, the essence of travel.</p>

<p>To follow an open road that beckons with a sweet sultry strangeness into the
immense horizon, then to find yourself on the other end of that road in a novel
town, wheeling over the choppy cobblestone that you should appreciate as well-preserved colonial ambiance, yet can’t help but loathe as your teeth and sanity chatter out of your skull, ambling down street after street in this unknown place looking for an unknown destination where you can strip off those clothes encrusted in white layers of dried sweat, one layer for each day since your last icy cold shower like anthropomorphized tree rings, all the while dodging llama toting natives, creaky hand carts piled to the heavens with fresh colorful vegetables that put the surgically sorted shrink-wrapped cartons of genetically engineered greens and reds from your homeland to shame, and, don’t forget, the <em>put-put</em>-ing mototaxis that swarm around you in a choking cloud of black exhaust like metal bees from some Industrial Revolution era experiment gone horribly wrong; to lose yourself in this otherness, in this now-ness, with no intentions other than to keep moving, this is the essence of travel.</p>

<p>However, there is a certain comfort in <em>the known</em>.</p>

<p>For example, one can’t deny the mundane pleasure that comes from seeing familiar
faces, such as the little old lady’s craggy face that is split by a large
broken-toothed smile, as you approach in the neighborhood market to buy your three dollars of weekly produce. You’re no longer just another well off <em>gringo</em>, emissary from the land of iPads and flip-flops, but you have a name and a small loyalty, for a time at least.</p>

<p>Moreover, the comfort derived from a reliably hot (if not reliably flowing) shower and a familiar bed cannot be overstated.</p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as
you do not stop.</p><p>&#8212;Confucius</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m slowing down for a stretch in Cuzco, Peru. This involves breaking my minimalist
tradition and obtaining a few things: an apartment, roommates, and a real
towel. But I’m not calling Cuzco home, rather I’m temporarily taking advantage of the
location to indulge another hobby of mine: language learning. This week
I started studying Quechua, the native language of the Incas and second
official language of Peru.</p>

<p>Off the bike saddle and into the classroom. I can’t help but wonder how long it will be before the road, that irresistible temptress, seduces me back.</p>

                    <p><strong>From: Huaraz, Peru</strong></p>

<p>It is 2012. Over a month has passed since my last entry, though don’t mistake
the silence for inactivity. Quite a bit happened
the past month.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the border, my hands were a blistery mess secreting a vile
pus, thanks to the rough dirt roads and my lack of an adequate front
suspension. As much as I wanted to continue on by bike, the sharp gut-wrenching
pain radiating from my palms precluded any attempt to secure a strong grip on
the handlebars. Instead, I attached myself, my bike, and 4 bags to a group of
three swell Germans who arrived by bus. The next two weeks were spent in
their convivial company traveling around Northern Peru.</p>

<p>Too lazy to go into detail about the following period, though I’ll do the math
for you: in those 4 weeks of December I cycled a mere 3 days. For all my
diligent stalkers out there here was my route.</p>

<ul>
  <li>La Balsa (border) to Chachapoyas (collectivo)</li>
  <li>Chachapoyas to Leymebamba (bike, 1 day, 80km)</li>
  <li>Leymebamba to Cajamarca (bus)</li>
  <li>Cajamarca to Trujillo (bike, 2 days, 285km)</li>
  <li>Trujillo to Lima (bus)</li>
  <li>Lima to Trujillo (bus)</li>
</ul>

<p>While I still scribbled a bit in my journal every couple days, every time
I attempted to muster up the motivation to write more I found
a convenient distraction. Often, the process of putting to paper coherent and connected
sentences from the turbulent nebula of my thoughts resembles an undesired chore.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-QMH9D73/0/M/6714703861c450baedb6o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Winding slowly down the mountains outside Cajamarca. The road snakes off into the distance towards the desert.</p>

<p>The two day, 285km bike ride from Cajamarca in the Andes to Trujillo on the
 coast was gorgeous. Starting at 8,900 ft
 (2,700m) you climb over 2,400ft (750m) before starting the long windy descent
 towards the coast. The scenery gradually changes from mountain scrub to desolate desert.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-V2XpjRV/0/M/671469864199965d989bo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Fixing a flat in the hot barren desert.</p>

<p>In Trujillo I stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas, a place famous among everyone
 whose cycled in South America. Lucho, a retired racing cyclist, has been
 opening his house to traveling cyclists for over 25 years. He provides a bed,
 shower, and great company for as along as you want, <strong>for free</strong>. I took
 advantage of his hospitality for a week and spent the New Years with Lucho and
 his family.</p>

The House of Cyclists</p>

<p>The morning after arriving in Trujillo I hopped on a bus for the 10 hour
journey to Lima to visit a good ‘ol friend from Ecuador who was heading back
to the USA with her tail between her legs. Guess she couldn’t handle the
awesomeness that was Peru.</p>

<p>Christmas in Lima. Bus back to Trujillo. Stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas. New
Years in Trujillo. Hello 2012.</p>
