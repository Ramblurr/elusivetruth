                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Kleve, Germany (January 9, 2012)</p>

<p>We’re a bit more than a week into 2013 and I’m a week into my <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html" title="A Boy, his Bike, and his Boat">self-powered amphibious journey across
Europe</a>.</p>

<p>On January 1 <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2013/01/27/power-of-beginnings.html" title="Power of Beginning">I began</a>. The romantic in me insisted I begin as close as
possible to that point where the River Rhine delta disappears into the North Sea,
otherwise the Sea-to-Sea narrative would be a sham.</p>

<p>Tracking down the end of a river isn’t a straightforward task, you see, for
the great pulsing artery of life, trade, and history that is the river Rhine
was torn open some 200 km away by the scalpel of some prehistoric geographic
surgeon millennia ago. Much like a human artery, there’s rarely a clean
incision. Yes, a river’s end is a messy affair. It squirts and gushes in
branching streams that run through the landscape until it is swallowed by the Sea.</p>

<p>After tracing lines on a map and I found a beach on Holland’s North Sea coast, where,
best I could figure, some majority of the silted water molecules flowing out
into the grey expanse fancied themselves the River Rhine.</p>

<p>Strolling across the beach on that brisk winter morning full of beginnings
I sought the moment. It’s a ritual I’ve learned from other wandering dreamers,
other mad ones, madder than I. In our pursuit of the euphoric we squeeze the
moment tight like a wet piece of laundry. We suck up every last bit of
serenity, inhale it, steep ourselves in the ecstasy of the extemporaneous. Its
the traveler’s high.</p>

<p>So for a moment I stood there, feeling the gentle give of the sand underfoot,
and the heavy weight of my bike packed with the trappings of my life. The salty
chill stung my flushing face as the wind rushed past. The river’s confluence
with the sea murmured steadily while the gulls road that chilly wind up into
the sky. Their intermittent caws, praises to the great open, lifted my spirit
and I saw the road, that glorious symbol of freedom and life, stretching ahead
into the enticing unknown.</p>

<p>And the moment passed, wrung of all its beauty. Those fragments of experience
lingered but the wholeness of it was gone. It was time to move on.</p>

<p>I snapped a selfie, turned my back to the Sea and with the river on my right
I peddled upstream.</p>

<p>Cycling in the Netherlands is unique experience. There are no hills, unless you
count the little ramps up the dikes, and dedicated cycling paths criss cross
the entire country.  It’s almost boring frankly.  I did have some antics to
keep me entertained.</p>

<p>Several times I encountered water crossings that required boarding a free ferry to
a cross 100 meter stretch of water. It didn’t really occur to me until I was
wheeling my load up the on ramp of the first ferry, I’m on a <em>human powered</em>
journey, crossing a bit of river on a ferry, no matter how short, is definitely
cheating. Plus, this is why I have a raft, right? Hell yes! I frantically
scrambled back down the on ramp like a madman with a profound ship-deck phobia.</p>

<p>Every time I peddled up to a ferry crossing and proceeded to
conjure a massive raft out of seemingly nowhere, then miraculously fit all my
crap into it, <em>including my bike</em>, there were many a stunned onlooker gaping
incredulously as I paddled towards the opposite shore.</p>

<p>The weather has been great so far. Too great actually. Temperatures haven’t
even dipped below freezing, and I’ve sun on my face more often than not.  My
photos can attest to this decidedly gorgeous weather.</p>

<p>Where is winter? The things worth doing are miserable. <em>Bring on the misery.</em></p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Mainz, Germany (February 29, 2013)</p>

<p>Today I say farewell to the river Rhine as I take a turn onto the river Main.
Over 500 kilometers I cycled along her banks, yet it was nought but a drop in
the voluminous mass of history and mystery that flows through her. Her journey
and my journey were intertwined shortly, yet the Rhine’s journey is one
thousands of years in progress. She knew nothing of my presence. Nonetheless,
I am better off for it.</p>

<p>My stretch along the Main will be even shorter, a mere interlude before the great
affair that will be the Danube.</p>

<p>The past few hundred kilometers were spectacular. Castles suddenly looming out
of the mist and snow so often I became immune to their archaic charm. Today
alone I must have passed half a dozen.</p>

                    <p><strong>From</strong>: Main-Danube Canal, Germany (23 March, 2013)</p>

<p>Finding a camping spot last night was tough. Rode past beautiful forests and
fields all day, but when dusk came the land was either all tilled earth
<em>(sure sign spring is coming if the farmers are out ripping up my tenting sites)</em>,
thickets of prickly brambles, or soft comfy grass but all
angled at a gut-wrenching 45 degrees!</p>

<p>Over an hour I rolled on through the dark, jerking over every moon-shadowed
pothole in the uneven dirt path until it dead ended in a cul-de-sac surrounded
by water.  I had taken a wrong turn into a tiny peninsula jutting into the
canal.  But what a dead end it was, anything but dead to my tired eyes, the
first flat stretch of even earth I’d seen for miles. The moonlight bathed it in
an enchanting glow and I half expected fairies to jump out and proclaim me
their king, or lull me into a sleep from which I’d awake their captive.</p>

<p>I laid out my ground cloth and sleeping bag dispensing with the tent entirely.
Consumed with that singular sensation of bliss earned through great exhaustion
I unfolded tired limbs onto my pad and stared bleary eyed into the infinite
depths of the Milky Way. Whatever thoughts were trickling through my head are
long gone, whisked into the heavens by a wintry zephyr and the deep soulful
rumblings of the river barges as they trundled past.</p>

<p>This gentle patch of earth might not look like much, but it was home for a night.</p>
</div>

<p>Today I made it to Regensberg! Significant, because it means I’ve joined
the Danube. I’ll paddle this river until it empties into the Black Sea, some
1500 miles and 8 countries from here. I embark on my raft Monday.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Straubing, Germany <em>(March 26, 2013)</em></p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/uploads/2013/03/ice-800.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Rough day. A strong icy cross wind blew most of the day. Water dripping down
from my paddle froze. Froze everywhere.</p>

<p>Faced my first lock in this frigid weather. A mere 400m, no distance at all
when riding a bicycle, but a herculean feat when with a raft laden with nearly
80 pounds of gear. Boats on land are quite cumbersome things.</p>

<p>Luckily there was a push cart for kayaks available. My raft didn’t fit
gracefully, but I managed.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>Portaging over a lock using the handy kayak cart.</p>
</div>

<p>While slowly trudging the 400m (200m uphill then 200m downhill), my thoughts
drifted to the early polar explorers. My slight inconvenience here in the
middle of Europe couldn’t compare to their accounts of the fierce blizzards and
dark winters huddled in huts sucking seal blubber but slowly starving.</p>

<p>Either the cold numbed my brain or the daydreaming about advancing upon the
South Pole distracted me, regardless, I did something incredibly stupid.</p>

<p>I pulled my raft over a sharp rock and tore a hole in her bottom. Of course I didn’t
realize this as I loaded the raft, nor as I paddled out into the river.</p>

<p>Oh sure, there was this nagging concern that floated to the surface of
awareness: <em>why the hell are my feet so cold?</em> I pushed the thought away, <em>“of
course my feet are cold. My hands are cold, my face is cold. I’m covered in
ice, everything is cold.”</em></p>

<p>It wasn’t until the creeping chill reached my ankles that the realization
pierced my stupor like an icicle lobotomy.</p>

<p><strong>Holy shit, there’s a fuckton of water in here!</strong></p>

<p>The subsequent moments were followed by such a fierce flurry of paddling, I
likely broke some packraft landspeed records. I did a harsh 180 degree turn and
made for the portage embankment.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after unloading everything and flipping her over, there was a
quarter sized rip in the bottom. A substantial repair would be required.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/uploads/2013/03/hole-800.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fighting feelings of defeat and inadequacy, I solemnly rolled up the raft,
assembled the bike and rolled on to find a hide-away where I could build a
fire, get warm, and regroup.</p>

<p>Later, curled up in my sleeping bag next to the glowing embers of a dying fire
I pulled up Scott’s Last Expedition on my Kindle where I encountered this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every day some new fact comes to light - some new obstacle which threatens
the gravest obstruction. I suppose this is the reason which makes the game so
well worth playing.”<br />
— Robert Falcon Scott, Antarctic Explorer (1868 - 1912)</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Vienna, Austria (May 10, 2013)</p>

<p>Spring has finally arrived. I set out to <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html">paddle and pedal</a> my way
across Europe in the winter in the name of slow human-powered travel, but I’ve
gone so slow Spring herself as overtook me.  The winter was a challenge; I am
rueful to see it go. Oh, selective amnesia, you put that rosy nostalgic glow on
even the <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2013/05/08/daily.html">miserable times</a>.</p>

<p>Drying my belongings in the wonderful spring breeze</p>
</div>

<p>There are a few drawbacks to winter’s departure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>

    <p>Insects and spiders have arrived. The joy of camping is undermined by the
 creepy scrambling of spiders over the forest floor where you’d like to roll
 out your bed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Food Spoilage</strong></p>

    <p>This caught me unaware. Turns out I was using the winter outdoors as a
 limitless, carbon-neutral refrigerator. All foods would remain tasty for
 days in my food sack stored outside my tent or strapped onto my
 bike/raft.</p>

    <p>Come spring time and now I can no longer carry much meat (love them
 campfire steaks!). Also, sticks of butter now have a nasty habit of
 going soft and gooing everywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugs</strong> - did I mention spiders?  <em>shudder</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Outside Vienna I met an amazing French couple cycling from France to the Black
Sea <em>with their two young boys</em>, a journey of over four months. I encountered
them on the Danube bike path while biking around a lock. We said a few nice
words, Florent helped me with a bag that had come loose, then we parted ways.
Curiosity go the better of me however, so I turned back and asked if I could
follow them to the campground they were aiming for.</p>

<p>“<em>Why?</em>”, I asked, “<em>How did you choose such a trip?</em>”. Their response was
simple, “<em>we wanted to go on a family trip that was fun and cheap</em>”.</p>

<p>We shared dinner near at the campground in Klosterneuburg, it was a lovely
evening that I’m lucky to have shared with this sincerely awesome family.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Budapest, Hungary (May 20, 2013)</p>

<p>Long lapses in days are common for me on this journey, and I would be hard pressed
to account for it. What can I say? I meet many kind and interesting people, eat
many tasty foreign treats, and, invariably, some portion of the stop I spend in
devotion to the gods of work, hunched in front of my computer. I do feel guilty
for the stops, not out of worry for the itinerary (hah!), but for neglecting
the road.</p>

<p>I find time upon the road, chasing down the horizon, is where I feel most
comfortable. The cities tempt me to remain, and I do enjoy these urban
interludes. I stay a day, a week, or longer, but eventually the spirit moves and
I move with it, enriched by the delay<a href="http://binaryelysium.com/prose/graham/the_gentle_art.html#21" title="Excerpts from, The Gentle Art of Tramping (1927)">*</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, after a lackadaisical few weeks in Vienna drowning myself in tasty
coffee, one tiny cup of <em>melange</em> or <em>einspänner</em> at a time, the imminent
expiration of my Schengen Visa (the visa covering most of the European Union)
motivated me onwards. Over 500km through Slovakia and Hungary faced me before
the border of the EU, and fearing I wouldn’t make it in my pokey boat, I biked
most of this leg.</p>

<p>Crossing borders in Europe today is surreal if you know even an inkling of
history. Within a few hours of leaving Vienna I crossed an imaginary line
into the Slav world, the “wild east”. The utter lack of fanfare in which I
crossed from Austria into Slovakia is in stark contrast to the violent and
tumultuous history of the region.</p>

<p>Four hundred years previous I would have crossed the front line in the
Ottoman’s great assault on the West. How different would things be now had the
Turks succeeded in capturing Vienna?</p>

<p>Fifty years ago I would have crossed the Iron Curtain and with it crossed the
ideological boundary over which the next half-century would be fought, not with
guns or bombs (well, not too many), but with words and fear.</p>

<p>Instead, I peddled past a clump of abandoned guard buildings, no police or
flags in sight.</p>

                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Novi Sad, Serbia (Aug 23, 2013)</p>

<p>Goals can be a bad thing. There I said it!</p>

<p>When I make a goal I feel, sometimes I feel restricted by it. As if the act of
committing to a goal involves being shrink-wrapped in cellophane and smothered
until the goal is completed.</p>

<p>Suffering from some sort of undiagnosed attention disorder, invariably,
another alluring prize comes along knocking me off course.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> My aborted cycle-across South America trip</p>

<p>The goal was to cycle across South America, but I only got some 1000km into the journey
before falling in love with <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily.html" title="Going Domestic In Cuzco">the Andes and the Quechua language</a>. I ended up
spending over a year in the Andes never stepping foot further south than Peru.</p>

<p><strong>It’s happening again!</strong> That is to say, this blather is a long winded
confession to a new goal.  I am deviating temporarily from my trans-Europe
waterway route along the Danube for a month or so to take a roundabout in the
Balkans, specifically former Yugoslavia and Albania.</p>

<p>This region is too interesting, too unique, and <em>too close</em> to pass up.</p>

<p>Today I’m stowing the boat and riding southwest from Novi Sad towards Sarajevo in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>Of course this means I’ll be paddling the rest of the Danube in the winter, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Tzcxe8MR1l0" title="Video Update: Ice, Ice Everywhere!">I’m no stranger to winter</a>.</p>

<p>My planned route through the Balkans is in <mark style="color: #DF3AFC;background:none;font-weight:bold;">purple</mark> on the map.  Reality often
doesn’t go as planned. But the beauty in life comes from the unexpected and
unimagined. I’m OK with that, even if that means putting other goals on hold.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any suggestions for my Balkan Detour? Places to visit, people to meet?</strong></p>
