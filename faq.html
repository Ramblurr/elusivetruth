Well that's the question isn't it? Answer that question and you'll be able to
solve all the world's problems. Or maybe not. I sure don't
know the answer, so you won't find it here.

Sorry, I get like that occasionally. My thoughts tend to <em>wander</em>. Speaking of <em>wandering</em>, that's what I do.

I guess you could call it traveling, as my <em>wandering</em> looks sort of like that. I've been on the road in one form or another since 2006. <br /><br /> But it's not really traveling, you see. I'm not going anywhere.

I'm not traveling, that's the thing. I'm moving. I love to move, I can't stay still. Some might call it a compulsion, they might not be wrong. Movement is my life.

Ah! Now this is is the question, enough of the vagaries of the mind and the abstract! Life is <em>in</em> the world and full of the unexpected, the unanticipated, the unimagined.<br/><br/>You can find where I'm living life on <a href="http://elusivetruth.net">my map</a>. Currently I am traveling east.

East? East from where? To where?

Well in January 2013, I found myself in the Netherlands along the North Sea coast. I <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html" title="A Boy, his Bike, and his Boat">began heading east by biycle and raft</a>. I'm over in Eastern Europe now, nominally heading east. Not "to" anywhere, just east.

Bicycle, raft?!

Yeah, a <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html" title="The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride a bike">few years ago in South America</a> I discovered a passion for slow-travel.
What better slow-travel is there than the human-powered kind? The bicycle
allows me to carry everything I need to be mostly self-sufficient on the road.
<br/><br/>
Since then I've picked up an inflatable packraft that I can pack on the bike, and stow the bike on. The raft allows me to navigate lakes, rivers and, maybe even seas. <br/>
