                    <p>I spent 3 nights and 4 days deep in the Amazon Jungle. It was unforgettable.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi27gr0qs1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>The trip started with an 8 hour overnight bus ride from Quito (where I&#8217;m based in Ecuador) to the small oil city of Lago Agrio close to the Colombian border. This was my first extended bus ride in Ecuador. Going in I was wary, as I had heard several scary stories about Ecuadorian buses. For the most part I was worried about scams and ruses to separate me from (and then run off with) my bag. For example, a common ruse is to use a pretty girl or friendly face to distract you while a partner reaches under your chair (from the chair behind yours) and steals stuff from your bag (or takes the whole thing). Thankfully I didn&#8217;t have any problems aside from not getting much sleep. I placed my bag on the floor between my feet, and was so wary that every little bump or sway caused me to jerk awake in alarm.</p>

<p>The bus arrived in Lago Agrio at the fresh hour of 7am. Being the stubborn and stingy type, I refused to take a $1.00 taxi to the prescribed meeting point (a hotel in the center of town). Instead, I used the little map the travel agent had given me to walk there, after all, the map made it appear that the hotel was a mere 5-6 blocks away. After wandering through mostly poor and fairly sketchy neighborhoods for 20 minutes, it became clear the map was more of a conceptual guide (e.g., the hotel is down and left from the bus station) than a navigational aid (e.g., walk one block on Luis street, then turn right on &#8230; etc).</p>

<p>Using my fledgling Spanish (&#8220;Dónde <em>&lt;some street name&gt;?&#8221;</em>), I sought directions from the locals. As is apparently typical of small Ecuadorian cities, none of the streets were signed and few locals even knew their names! I did happen across a few knowledgeable and helpful locals who gave what I suppose were decent directions in Spanish, but, of course, I couldn&#8217;t understand them. In the end hand frantic hand waving saved the day.</p>

<p>From this experience I have developed this short</p>

<p><strong>Dictionary of Hand Waving Directions:</strong></p>

<ul><li>one wave in a direction and a tilt of the head = <em>&#8220;should I go this way?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>one wave in a direction and nod = <em>&#8220;that way is probably right. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but don&#8217;t want to be embarrassed.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>using two hands (in clapping position) to show distance = <em>&#8220;how far should I go?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>strong multiple waves in a direction = <em>&#8220;go a long way!&#8221;</em> (or, maybe,<em> &#8220;get out of here!&#8221;</em>)</li>

</ul><p>I finally stumbled upon the hotel, because I noticed several gringos lounging in chairs and sipping coffee out front. I hadn&#8217;t seen one gringo during my trek, so I figured these ones must be on to something. Even the hotel lacked clear signage!</p>

<p>The gringos were in fact waiting for the same jungle expedition as I, so I joined them for a simple breakfast of coffee and eggs (literally, just coffee and eggs. There was no salt, pepper, hot sauce, fruit, or bread). The group consisted of me, the token American, a 30-ish Swiss accountant, a 20-something French woman, and two 20-something Canadian sisters (Geological engineer and nurse).</p>

<p>We busied ourselves with food and introductory conversation. I would become fairly well acquainted with these gringos over the next 4 days, for we were all in the same group. We ate, slept, explored, and almost literally (explanation forthcoming) showered together. Of course, at this point in the story we didn&#8217;t know any of these things.</p>

<p>9:00&#160;o&#8217; clock rolled around and our transportation arrived. </p>

<p>The next leg of the journey was yet another bus ride. This time in a smaller bus and a length of only 2 and a half hours. With a quick pit stop at the airport to pick up two more Americans (a father and 19 yr-old son), we blasted off onto a narrow, winding road into the country. As we progressed the landscape transformed from generic temperate green surroundings into exotic leafy, viney jungle. Unfortunately, I missed most of this transformation because buses put me to sleep. </p>

<p>When I awoke we had pulled off the road and up to the edge of a river where a very long, narrow boat was waiting for us. We hustled out of the bus and loaded our belongings into the front of the boat, then donned very stinky and ill-fitting life jackets. I suspect the life-jackets were a formality of sorts whilst we were in site of the national park rangers manning the shack where we paid our $1.00 entrance fee. This was to be the only boat ride (of which we had many) where we wore life jackets.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi1tp2umT1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>Excited, talkative, and smelling of jungle mold, we boarded the boat two by two. Our boat driver gave the outboard motor a quick pull, the engine roared to life, and we were off! As we navigated away from the bank, I gave a quick look over my shoulder and said goodbye to civilization. Where we were headed there would be no roads: deep into the Amazon jungle.</p>

<p><em>(It would appear I am somewhat wordy. 700 words in and I&#8217;ve only just gotten to the jungle bit, so I am going to split this trip across multiple posts. Check back in a day or two for the sequel.)</em></p>
