                    <p>Solo traveling is an inherently complicated and risky endeavor. A foreigner wandering city streets alone makes an inviting quarry for street toughs and petty thieves. Even something simple as going to the bathroom when in a restaurant or cafe becomes difficult as the solitary traveler has no one to watch their things or their back.</p>

<p><a title="Solo Traveler by Sparky_R, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkys_pics/3381805319/"><img alt="Solo Traveler" height="353" width="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3381805319_e397d5d84f.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>On the other hand traveling unaccompanied is an immensely rewarding experience. The fewer number of people in a group, the easier it is to make decisions, and believe me when I say that decision making can paralyze a group and turn a would-be fun day (or trip!) into one remembered only for the arguments and amount of grief shared by all. When you are a group of one, the task of deciding where to eat, what to visit, how long to stay, etc., is completely up to your taste and inclinations. To travel with others often involves sacrificing self autonomy for group think, something I&#8217;m not particularly keen on. When alone you can follow your feelings and instincts without having to put them into words to convince a partner.</p>

<p>Before this update devolves into a treatise on solo travel, I want to share a recent story that came about because I was traveling alone.</p>

<p>Last Saturday morning at my hostel in Quito, Ecuador I was sipping my coffee and tallying the previous day&#8217;s expenses in my little black notebook when a tall gringo walked in and busied himself with making a breakfast of toast and juice. </p>

<p>The breakfast room is a great location for meeting fellow travelers. Swapping backgrounds and tales of adventures over a steaming cup of café is great way to shake of the morning grogginess. This swapping started of as most do: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Casey. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? How long are you traveling? Why <em>&lt;insert current location&gt;</em>?&#8221;. The tall gringo turned out to be a fellow named Mike from Pennsylvania who had volunteered with low-income families and kids here in Quito for 2 years about 15 years ago. He comes back every year for 10 days to visit the kids (who&#8217;ve grown up) and various friends.</p>

<p>Anyway, we swapped our plans for the weekend. Mine were pretty boring. This particular weekend in Quito was a holiday, so everything was shuttered and the streets were empty as people left for the beaches or countryside. I planned to stay inside and read a book, do some work, etc. As it turned out Mike was behaving like a local; and getting out of town. He had an old college (U Penn) friend who owns a Hacienda about 45 minutes out of Quito. Mike planned to spend weekend at the Hacienda visiting his friend&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>What happened next only occurred because I was traveling solo. After hearing and politely praising (but feeling inwardly jealous) Mike&#8217;s plans, he suddenly asked if I would like to accompany him. I suppose he took pity on my meager weekend plans. </p>

<p>Accepting the offer was risky, with out a doubt, for I did not know this man inviting me out into the countryside, but it was simply too good to pass up. The proposition was surreal: accompany him by taxi (for free) to the Hacienda, eat dinner with the family (for free), sleep in one of the many guest rooms (for free), take two more meals (for free), and relax all Sunday on the estate&#8217;s grounds. Had I booked a similar trip through proper channels I would have paid upwards of $500, and that wouldn&#8217;t have included the quality time with an Ecuadorian family.</p>

<p>Long story short, I went! It was utterly fantastic!</p>

<p>I took quite a few pictures of the estate&#8217;s grounds, though I shied away from taking many inside as I didn&#8217;t want to come across as a nosy outsider photographing the private sanctum of this family&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The photos are pretty self explanatory. All in all it was a great experience getting a peek into Ecuadorian family life. Admittedly, this family is in the extreme upper class (they have live in servants), so the peek wasn&#8217;t representative of Ecuadorian life, nonetheless it was a unique experience.</p>

<p>Had I been in a group, I never would have been invited into this family&#8217;s home. Chalk one up to solo travel.</p>
