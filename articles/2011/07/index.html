                <div class="entry">
                    <p>The past couple weeks I have been hanging out with a local Ecuadorian named Ana. She’s originally from here in Quito, but is well traveled and speaks English quite well, though I try to to get by in Spanish as much as possible. Her best personality trait, and the reason I’m even writing this update on this topic, is just how friendly and open she is about sharing her country and culture. Case in point, after only hanging out twice she invited me to travel with her family on a day-trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujil%C3%AD">Pujili, Ecuador</a> (that’s <em>Poo-hi-li</em>) to watch the Corpus Christi Festival. Without her I wouldn’t have had this unforgettable experience, thanks Ana!</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-xBDtrP2/0/M/58733101108419497598o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Not such a flattering picture for the girl on the right, but I love this picture for the color.</p>

<p>The event is the Festival of Corpus Christi, a Catholic holiday here that <em>happens</em> to coincide with the traditional Inca holiday celebrating the Sun God. The main event is a <strong>long</strong> dancing parade, followed by loads of drinking and cockfights. It lasts all weekend, but unfortunately I could only visit on Saturday. People come from all over Ecuador, even Colombia and Bolivia, representing their local culture (both past and present) by dressing up in traditional dress and dancing in the parade. Allegedly, some of the costume and dancing styles date back to the Incas themselves, though I’m no historian, I just enjoy watching the myriad colors and differences in designs.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-Kbf4D2J/0/M/5872764501c2d6fe99eeo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-2vKpP3k/0/M/58727638958f255fab1co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
These two photos illustrate the large differences in regional style.</p>

<p>A recounting of this festival wouldn’t be complete without a mention of liquor, and in particular <em>my</em> experience with it. It is a custom among the parade-goers to <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056165044&amp;k=ndg6rm5&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">offer the dancers liquor</a> as they bounce by, which is all well and fine, though I suspect many of the dancers are quite smashed by the time they reach the end of the parade. <em>Another</em> custom is for those in the parade to offer liquor to the spectators, <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056166395&amp;k=fk2x437&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">usually from little plastic jugs</a> and a single shared shot glass. I have nothing against this custom, per se, as sharing your local brew is as important as sharing your costumes; however, there was some understood rule that <em>the gringos</em> <em>must</em> try <em>all</em> the liquor. I admit I don’t blend in particularly well in my REI rain-jacket, polyester pants, and, oh yea, my <strong>glowing white skin</strong>, but I tried to keep my back to the wall and observe as best I could (all my pictures were taken from the sidelines). Needless to say, once the fellows with the shot glasses got a lock on the gringo beacon, they made a beeline in our direction, arms outstretched, ready to pour some vile, burning liquid down our throats. After the third or fourth I was pretty much done, but to refuse was unthinkable, so I developed a routine to deal with the pain: smile, mutter “<em>salut</em>”, glug glug, grimace, yay!</p>

<p>As if the festivities were boring already, the locals thought of another way to liven things up: dance with the foreigners! At first I refused because I’m a horrible dancer–these were clearly professionals–and I wanted to keep playing my invisible observer role, or at least that’s what I was telling myself. In reality when you travel, you’re never invisible, and the locals have the same right to look at you as you do at them. In this case I wasn’t being harassed by the locals (even though that is how it felt at times), far from it indeed! They were simply being gracious hosts and trying to make the experience as fun for both of us as possible. Being drawn into the local culture, especially at their request, is special, and truth be told, it was disrespectful to sit there watching and taking pictures but refusing to get involved. “<em>I really don’t like dancing</em>”, I kept telling myself, but a crucial part of traveling is getting outside your comfort zone, something I had forgotten.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/4076310756/" title="The Road by Stuck in Customs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4076310756_e35702feec.jpg" width="500" alt="The Road" /></a></p>

<p>This post is part confession and part announcement. I need to come clean about a decision I’ve been wrestling with for months and decided weeks ago but have yet to share:</p>

<p><strong>I’m extending my trip indefinitely.</strong></p>

<p>For some of you this may not be much of a surprise, but I’ve decided to transition to a permanent traveling (<em>nomadic</em>, if you will) lifestyle. This trip to Ecuador is not a vacation or an after-graduation treat, rather it is the first step in a journey that will take me (I hope) around the world. It is the next stage in my life.</p>

<p>There are few professions that are location independent and can support perpetual travel. The traditional professions of nomads have been musicians, writers, teachers, and volunteers (i.e., those who exchange work for food/accommodation). However, the widespread adoption of the Internet and computing technology in general has given rise to another profession suited to a nomadic lifestyle: <em>the high-tech hobo</em>. </p>

<p>I am incredibly fortunate to have developed the necessary passion and skills necessary to support my wandering lifestyle, because I certainly don’t have what it takes to be a professional musician or writer. Teaching and volunteering are two occupations I plan to try someday, in fact sooner than you might think, but that is for another post. Whether I can succeed at this lifestyle is another question, one I’ve spent the last month trying to answer.</p>

<p>The past 6 weeks I used as a trial period to determine if I could actually work while traveling. I had serious doubts as to whether I could perform my duties with just a tiny netbook and random wifi hotspots. As a programmer you come to expect (and take for granted) certain luxuries, such as the workstation below I used for the last year until I graduated.</p>

<div class="caption">
<img alt="My old glass desk with two 24 inch computer monitors" src="/uploads/2011/07/desk-500.jpg" />
<p>Was this all really necessary?</p>
</div>

<p>If you asked me a year ago if I could work full-time with a 10 inch monitor instead of two 24 inch screens, I would have laughed you out of town.</p>

<p>Just several months ago I was shopping around for a fancy “programmer’s chair”. These ergonomic chairs are designed to serve the ‘eccentric’ needs of programmers and other working professionals who sit in front of a computer desk for hours and hours at a time. They cost upwards of a $1000! Not too long ago I was certain I <em>had</em> to have one of these chairs; I thought I couldn’t work fulltime without one.</p>

<p>Yet, for the past month I’ve been spending my working hours on couches, benches, bar stools, and bunk-beds. Yes, my backside hurts, my spine isn’t too happy, and my hands are cramped from using such a tiny keyboard, <strong>but I’m not trapped in an office or a cubicle</strong>. <em>That alone</em> is worth the pain.</p>

<div class="caption">
<img alt="A small plain wooden chair and desk" src="/uploads/2011/07/wood-desk-500.jpg" />
<p>My current work place. Fancy chairs, screens, and desks be damned!</p>
</div>

<p>Phew! There. It’s out. This was a difficult decision that has been long in the making. It involved sacrificing some other dreams, and in future posts I might discuss how I got to this point.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure what I am going to do once I tire of traveling, for I know it is not realistic to believe I’ll always be consumed with this wanderlust. Though, at this point I’m not planning that far ahead. I’ve been planning my whole life since I was 13 years old. Right now my plans extend as far the end of August when my Ecuador visa expires. After that, who knows? Colombia? Peru? Africa? I’ll worry about that when I get there.</p>

<p>Enough planning. Enough thinking. <strong>It’s time to live in the moment.</strong></p>

<p>“But what if I want one of those ice-creams after I finish this?”, said my friend gesturing to her $1.50 hamburger.</p>

<p>“Then you can walk back to the town and get one”, responded my other friend matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>The first friend gazed with resentment at the 20m of soft sandy beach between her and the town, sighed, and lugubriously took a seat on the towel giving up on the ice-cream for the time being.</p>

<p>“You know,” started the second friend, <strong>“these aren’t real problems.”</strong></p>

<p>We laughed at the absurdity of getting in a huff over a short walk on a beautiful beach to an ice-cream vendor. Such is the lethargic lifestyle you slip into after a few days in a relaxing beach town.</p>

<p>Fast forward two days. Now we’re in a frantic dash through the town searching for the bus we booked 24 hours prior, but it has already left without us. We dawdled too long.</p>

<p>A public bus rolls up and a crowd of people rush toward it. Being in a pretty remote location along the coast of Ecuador, we know this bus might be our only chance to make it out tonight. In true Ecuadorian fashion we push and shove our way inside and claim 2 seats for ourselves. Even though I’m still barefoot I take one for the team and stand in the grimy, muddy aisle. </p>

<p>The bus pulls out into the night, and only then do we think to ask if it will drop us off anywhere near to where we need to be. We have 10pm tickets for our overnight bus from Libertad to Quito. It is 7:30pm, and with at least a 1.5hr ride from Montanita–though public buses are notorious for taking longer by taking frequent stops–we’ll be cutting it close.  We don’t even know where we need to go to catch our bus in Libertad.</p>

<p>A cockroach or two skitter across my feet, but I barely notice as I’m locked in struggle against gravity to keep my balance as the bus careens around black corners while crossing into the incoming lane. Meanwhile, worries are wheeling through my mind: <em>what’s</em> going to happen <em>if</em> we miss our bus? <em>What if</em> we can’t find the terminal? We all have work tomorrow morning, we’re probably going to miss it.</p>

<p>Arriving in an unfamiliar city at night with no plans for accommodation, much less a simple notion of where you are in the city is never a great idea. Given that this is Ecuador, the streets at night are most likely dangerous. Great!</p>

<p>The driver puts in a 90s dance mix, and the soul-searching strain of Haddaway’s “What is Love?” drifts above the raucous teenagers partying in the rear and the oppressive droning of the engine. </p>

<p>Haddaway's "What is Love" for your blog sing-along pleasure</p>
</div>

<p>As I begin to quietly sing along–<em>What is love?</em>–I mentally take a step back and laugh at the absurdity of the situation–<em>Oh baby, don’t hurt me</em>. Here I am, caught up in a huff about some minor transportation setbacks–<em>Don’t hurt me no more</em>–while on my way back from a luxurious beach getaway where I spent more in a weekend than people in the villages we’re driving past make in a two weeks.</p>

<p>The sage words of my friend suddenly coalesced in my mind:</p>

<blockquote><strong>These aren't real problems.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Throughout all my travels, I’ve yet to encounter a truly dire setback, and I think I’ve had my share of memorable obstacles: getting H1N1 in Egypt, ending up 8 hours off-course in remote eastern Turkey after a 12hr bus ride, taking sketchy private “taxis” at 1am from a Jordanian port.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/23/coming-out-so-to-speak.html">last post</a> I professed my desire to start framing my day-to-day life in the context of the moment, that is, I’ve resolved to put less emphasis on long term plans and issues. This is because I had let my perspective grow disproportionally large. There were so many goals and problems I was trying to court, that I simply felt overwhelmed. By contracting the scale of my outlook, I’ve been able to make my goals and problems manageable again. While I still believe this to be the right attitude for me to adopt, I am cognizant of the fact that I can’t become utterly consumed with the present lest I lose valuable perspective in the other direction.</p>

<p>Your problems can appear much more grievous and exigent than they would be if you placed them against the proper backdrop. Taking a mental step back and surrendering a little chuckle about your circumstances can make all the difference. </p>

<p>Back on the lurching bus, I bopped my head to Haddaway with a shit-eating grin on my face. We’d make it home, and if we didn’t, well, that would be another adventure. </p>
