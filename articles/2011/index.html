                    <p>Being separated from their luggage is fear shared by all budget travelers. This phobia is colloquially known as Backpackers Separation Anxiety (BSA). Often when traveling by bus or van, everyone&#8217;s luggage is heaped together in the underside storage compartment accessible from the outside. If the bus makes frequent stops the only guard you have against someone grabbing your bag is the trustworthiness of your fellow passengers, not a comforting situation. Not to mention that checking baggage when flying is inherently risky, and, more recently, a significant expense.</p>

<p>Given this aversion to being separated from one&#8217;s pack, it is crucial that the sum total of your belongings can be easily carrier on your back, stuffed in overhead bins, and even under seats. </p>

<p>My goal for this trip was to use a bag less than 30 liters (1800 cu. in.) and a packed weight of less than 15 lbs. Mouse over the items to see what they are.  </p>

<p>

<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161703&k=WLNL4ns&lb=1&s=A" title="Ecuador: All the clothing items I'm bringing"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-WLNL4ns/0/M/57693831805111b87542o-M.jpg" title="Ecuador: All the clothing items I'm bringing" alt="Ecuador: All the clothing items I'm bringing"></a>

</p>

<p>As you can see I brought 2 sets of pants, shirts, boxer briefs, and socks; one cotton t-shirt; one set of long underwear; one pair of sandals; one stuffable rain/wind jacket; and one pair of shoes. I am always wearing at least one set of clothing, so only one set is packed up.</p>

<p>Doing laundry every night or every other night becomes a necessity when you pack like this. A relaxed self esteem is also required, as you&#8217;re probably not going to look very fashionable and people will definitely notice you wearing the same clothes day after day. </p>

<p>
<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161735&k=jwSjDhp&lb=1&s=A" title="Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I'm bringing"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-jwSjDhp/0/M/5768843811e7bb812dd2o-M.jpg" title="Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I'm bringing" alt="Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I'm bringing"></a>
</p>

<p>The non-clothes supplies are fairly standard travelers gear: travel pouch, guidebook, clothesline, drain plug, soap, music device, flashlight, water bottle, lots of zip-loc bags, rubber bands, watch, notebooks and pens, sewing kit, and pack towel. Originally I wanted to avoid bringing a computer, opting instead to store my files on a small USB key, but when I decided I was going to work while traveling I was forced to bring a small netbook computer.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161677&k=WFwwg4h&lb=1&s=A" title="EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-WFwwg4h/0/M/57693829828d9a87cd32o-M.jpg" title="EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)" alt="EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)"></a>
</p>

<p>This is all my gear packed into my 28 liter (1700 cu. in) backpack next to a toilet paper roll for size comparison. It not only easily fits into the carry on bins, but also fits under the seat of most airplanes. In the end it ended up weighing about 18 lbs, more than the 15 lbs goal I had set, but I attribute that to the heavy laptop and charging cables thrown in at the last minute.</p>

<p>With this pack I can travel through civilization in reasonable comfort indefinitely, and rarely separate from my belongings.</p>

                    <p>Solo traveling is an inherently complicated and risky endeavor. A foreigner wandering city streets alone makes an inviting quarry for street toughs and petty thieves. Even something simple as going to the bathroom when in a restaurant or cafe becomes difficult as the solitary traveler has no one to watch their things or their back.</p>

<p><a title="Solo Traveler by Sparky_R, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkys_pics/3381805319/"><img alt="Solo Traveler" height="353" width="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3381805319_e397d5d84f.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>On the other hand traveling unaccompanied is an immensely rewarding experience. The fewer number of people in a group, the easier it is to make decisions, and believe me when I say that decision making can paralyze a group and turn a would-be fun day (or trip!) into one remembered only for the arguments and amount of grief shared by all. When you are a group of one, the task of deciding where to eat, what to visit, how long to stay, etc., is completely up to your taste and inclinations. To travel with others often involves sacrificing self autonomy for group think, something I&#8217;m not particularly keen on. When alone you can follow your feelings and instincts without having to put them into words to convince a partner.</p>

<p>Before this update devolves into a treatise on solo travel, I want to share a recent story that came about because I was traveling alone.</p>

<p>Last Saturday morning at my hostel in Quito, Ecuador I was sipping my coffee and tallying the previous day&#8217;s expenses in my little black notebook when a tall gringo walked in and busied himself with making a breakfast of toast and juice. </p>

<p>The breakfast room is a great location for meeting fellow travelers. Swapping backgrounds and tales of adventures over a steaming cup of café is great way to shake of the morning grogginess. This swapping started of as most do: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Casey. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? How long are you traveling? Why <em>&lt;insert current location&gt;</em>?&#8221;. The tall gringo turned out to be a fellow named Mike from Pennsylvania who had volunteered with low-income families and kids here in Quito for 2 years about 15 years ago. He comes back every year for 10 days to visit the kids (who&#8217;ve grown up) and various friends.</p>

<p>Anyway, we swapped our plans for the weekend. Mine were pretty boring. This particular weekend in Quito was a holiday, so everything was shuttered and the streets were empty as people left for the beaches or countryside. I planned to stay inside and read a book, do some work, etc. As it turned out Mike was behaving like a local; and getting out of town. He had an old college (U Penn) friend who owns a Hacienda about 45 minutes out of Quito. Mike planned to spend weekend at the Hacienda visiting his friend&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>What happened next only occurred because I was traveling solo. After hearing and politely praising (but feeling inwardly jealous) Mike&#8217;s plans, he suddenly asked if I would like to accompany him. I suppose he took pity on my meager weekend plans. </p>

<p>Accepting the offer was risky, with out a doubt, for I did not know this man inviting me out into the countryside, but it was simply too good to pass up. The proposition was surreal: accompany him by taxi (for free) to the Hacienda, eat dinner with the family (for free), sleep in one of the many guest rooms (for free), take two more meals (for free), and relax all Sunday on the estate&#8217;s grounds. Had I booked a similar trip through proper channels I would have paid upwards of $500, and that wouldn&#8217;t have included the quality time with an Ecuadorian family.</p>

<p>Long story short, I went! It was utterly fantastic!</p>

<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/25087727_6tJhzK#!i=2056136129&k=G3VTrQ2&lb=1&s=A" title="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front."><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/i-G3VTrQ2/0/M/577854767065e0cbb4cao-M.jpg" title="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front." alt="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front."></a>

<p>I took quite a few pictures of the estate&#8217;s grounds, though I shied away from taking many inside as I didn&#8217;t want to come across as a nosy outsider photographing the private sanctum of this family&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The photos are pretty self explanatory. All in all it was a great experience getting a peek into Ecuadorian family life. Admittedly, this family is in the extreme upper class (they have live in servants), so the peek wasn&#8217;t representative of Ecuadorian life, nonetheless it was a unique experience.</p>

<p>Had I been in a group, I never would have been invited into this family&#8217;s home. Chalk one up to solo travel.</p>

<p>This is a baked Guinea Pig, known is Spanish as <em>Cuy</em> (Koo-ee), prepared in the traditional Ecuadorian fashion.</p>

<p>The texture is quite like that of roasted chicken, but the flavor is decidedly porkish. The skin is very thick and (in my opinion) quite gross, not at all like the nice crispy skin of a chicken or juicy fat chunks from a beef steak.</p>

                    <p>I took a day trip from Quito to the equator (from which Ecuador takes its name) with a very friendly British couple (Lewis and Sara). </p>

<p>Apparently the equator makes it possible (or easier) to balance an egg, because of the opposing forces. In fact, the guide claimed all sorts of things are different at the equator: our weight, our strength, the direction water spirals, etc. I&#8217;m quite skeptical of all these claims, though I did manage to balance an egg on a nail.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, they are just tiny little mosquito bites. I have been assured that aside from itching like heck (they are called fire mosquitos), the bites and spots are perfectly harmless. They are a small price to pay for the experience of camping in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest far removed from civilization.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll post more pictures and a story or two about the trip soon.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>I spent 3 nights and 4 days deep in the Amazon Jungle. It was unforgettable.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi27gr0qs1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>The trip started with an 8 hour overnight bus ride from Quito (where I&#8217;m based in Ecuador) to the small oil city of Lago Agrio close to the Colombian border. This was my first extended bus ride in Ecuador. Going in I was wary, as I had heard several scary stories about Ecuadorian buses. For the most part I was worried about scams and ruses to separate me from (and then run off with) my bag. For example, a common ruse is to use a pretty girl or friendly face to distract you while a partner reaches under your chair (from the chair behind yours) and steals stuff from your bag (or takes the whole thing). Thankfully I didn&#8217;t have any problems aside from not getting much sleep. I placed my bag on the floor between my feet, and was so wary that every little bump or sway caused me to jerk awake in alarm.</p>

<p>The bus arrived in Lago Agrio at the fresh hour of 7am. Being the stubborn and stingy type, I refused to take a $1.00 taxi to the prescribed meeting point (a hotel in the center of town). Instead, I used the little map the travel agent had given me to walk there, after all, the map made it appear that the hotel was a mere 5-6 blocks away. After wandering through mostly poor and fairly sketchy neighborhoods for 20 minutes, it became clear the map was more of a conceptual guide (e.g., the hotel is down and left from the bus station) than a navigational aid (e.g., walk one block on Luis street, then turn right on &#8230; etc).</p>

<p>Using my fledgling Spanish (&#8220;Dónde <em>&lt;some street name&gt;?&#8221;</em>), I sought directions from the locals. As is apparently typical of small Ecuadorian cities, none of the streets were signed and few locals even knew their names! I did happen across a few knowledgeable and helpful locals who gave what I suppose were decent directions in Spanish, but, of course, I couldn&#8217;t understand them. In the end hand frantic hand waving saved the day.</p>

<p>From this experience I have developed this short</p>

<p><strong>Dictionary of Hand Waving Directions:</strong></p>

<ul><li>one wave in a direction and a tilt of the head = <em>&#8220;should I go this way?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>one wave in a direction and nod = <em>&#8220;that way is probably right. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but don&#8217;t want to be embarrassed.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>using two hands (in clapping position) to show distance = <em>&#8220;how far should I go?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>strong multiple waves in a direction = <em>&#8220;go a long way!&#8221;</em> (or, maybe,<em> &#8220;get out of here!&#8221;</em>)</li>

</ul><p>I finally stumbled upon the hotel, because I noticed several gringos lounging in chairs and sipping coffee out front. I hadn&#8217;t seen one gringo during my trek, so I figured these ones must be on to something. Even the hotel lacked clear signage!</p>

<p>The gringos were in fact waiting for the same jungle expedition as I, so I joined them for a simple breakfast of coffee and eggs (literally, just coffee and eggs. There was no salt, pepper, hot sauce, fruit, or bread). The group consisted of me, the token American, a 30-ish Swiss accountant, a 20-something French woman, and two 20-something Canadian sisters (Geological engineer and nurse).</p>

<p>We busied ourselves with food and introductory conversation. I would become fairly well acquainted with these gringos over the next 4 days, for we were all in the same group. We ate, slept, explored, and almost literally (explanation forthcoming) showered together. Of course, at this point in the story we didn&#8217;t know any of these things.</p>

<p>9:00&#160;o&#8217; clock rolled around and our transportation arrived. </p>

<p>The next leg of the journey was yet another bus ride. This time in a smaller bus and a length of only 2 and a half hours. With a quick pit stop at the airport to pick up two more Americans (a father and 19 yr-old son), we blasted off onto a narrow, winding road into the country. As we progressed the landscape transformed from generic temperate green surroundings into exotic leafy, viney jungle. Unfortunately, I missed most of this transformation because buses put me to sleep. </p>

<p>When I awoke we had pulled off the road and up to the edge of a river where a very long, narrow boat was waiting for us. We hustled out of the bus and loaded our belongings into the front of the boat, then donned very stinky and ill-fitting life jackets. I suspect the life-jackets were a formality of sorts whilst we were in site of the national park rangers manning the shack where we paid our $1.00 entrance fee. This was to be the only boat ride (of which we had many) where we wore life jackets.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi1tp2umT1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>Excited, talkative, and smelling of jungle mold, we boarded the boat two by two. Our boat driver gave the outboard motor a quick pull, the engine roared to life, and we were off! As we navigated away from the bank, I gave a quick look over my shoulder and said goodbye to civilization. Where we were headed there would be no roads: deep into the Amazon jungle.</p>

<p><em>(It would appear I am somewhat wordy. 700 words in and I&#8217;ve only just gotten to the jungle bit, so I am going to split this trip across multiple posts. Check back in a day or two for the sequel.)</em></p>

<p>After reading this article (<a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN0522204620110606">Ecuador’s Yasuni jungle protection plan</a>) by Reuters I couldn’t help but get the impression that Ecuador is ransoming its rainforest.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s not quite what the article says, but reading between the lines I certainly get the impression that Ecuador is telling the world “<em>Hey World! Give us a bunch of money or we’ll destroy this <a href="http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=ECU+02&amp;mode=all">UNESCO protected</a> nature reserve.</em>”</p>

<p>I’m not exactly an environmental activist (or oil advocate either), but this route seems pretty low. This stunt will allow Ecuador to blame everyone else but themselves if they have to start oil extraction in the rainforest.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Ecuador is morally in the clear?</strong></p>

                    <p>When <a title="An Amazon Expedition (part 1)" href="http://elusivetruth.net/post/6339375909/an-amazon-expedition-part-1">I last left the story</a> of my Amazon trip, my new friends and I had boarded a canoe <!--END-->and   headed into the Amazon Rainforest. The area we were headed into is called the Cuyabeno, a   portion of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. The Cuyabeno is a series of interconnected   lakes, lagoons, rivers, and floating forests that eventually drains into the Amazon River.   It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the world.</p>

<p>Enough with the book facts. <em>What did we do there? </em>I had trouble writing this update, as there was simply so much involved in this trip. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to give the reader a peek into the experience we had in the rainforest. Rather than gloss it over with a jazzy narrative or a play-by-play of each day, I am going to include a few photos of memorable moments. </p>

<p>We went on jungle hikes, where our guide used natural ingredients to create a stomach   soothing concoction for Oli (the one with the hat).

<p>We went fishing for and caught red-bellied piraña.

</p>

<p>After swimming, we silently watched the brilliant sun set over the forest teeming with the   sound of life.

</p>

<p>We ate, slept and showered in thatched wooden huts on stilts.

</p>

<p>We laughed and played cards by candle light. We shared a miserable rainy jungle trek, and   bonded over hours of grueling paddling. </p>

<p>My words can&#8217;t begin to describe all that went into the experience. The photos can do a slightly better job, but so much of the experience was un-capturable by camera. In the end, the total experience is a only a shared memory of those seven people you see above, which is a special, yet at the same time a somber fact. We came together for a short time, strangers from all over the world, shared intense and unforgettable moments, and then scattered back into the wind.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>For the past several weeks I’ve essentially been living in Quito, Ecuador. Most people would probably disagree that I’m ‘living’ here, after all, I’ve only been here four weeks. While I don’t claim to know Quito particularly well, it certainly feels like I’m living here. For me, ‘living’ someplace implies a routine or a certain regularity to your activities. ‘Traveling’ suggests just the opposite. Travelers rarely do the same thing more than once in the same location. For example, I walk the same way to Spanish lessons every day, frequent the same grocery store, and grab an espresso at the same cafe. Travelers might do some of those things, but it would be exceptional for one to make a repeat visit. Whereas, I have fallen into a predictable routine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wake up around 6:30 am</li>
  <li>Coffee until 7am</li>
  <li>Work until 9am</li>
  <li>Spanish Lessons until 1pm</li>
  <li>Work until 6 or 7pm</li>
  <li>Drinks with a local or foreigner</li>
  <li>In bed by 11 pm</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, ‘living’ some place involves a sense of permanency that I don’t associate with my stay here in Quito. When people ask why I am in Quito I answer “learning Spanish”; I’m not here to work and I’m not merely here to see the tourist attractions. Quito is an interesting city, and I really enjoy getting to know her and her people, but I won’t stay forever. Being here on a tourist visa places a hard limit on the length of time I can be in Ecuador. Even if I choose to renew my visa for another three months, I won’t spend the entire duration in Quito.</p>

<p>Another indication that I’m living in Quito, or at least begun to tire of my routine, is how agitated I felt last week with the desire to escape the city for several days. While the noise, traffic, and pollution in Quito aren’t near as bad as Cairo (where I lived for a year), they do take a toll on your mental state.</p>

(by Guillaume Lavaure on Flickr)</p></div>

<p>On Thursday I decided I wanted to get out, so I began a semi-frantic search for somewhere to go. Via this great site called <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> (a facebook-esque site for travelers—I’ll write more about it at some point), I met an American named Lindsay. She had a tent and the same itch to escape our urban confinement. We made our plans on Friday: check out a region high in the Andes mountains called Quilotoa, hike around, and camp somewhere if possible.</p>

<p>We had no clue if camping was a possible, apparently camping isn’t a popular activity in Ecuador. Optimistic that we would figure it out, we hopped on a bus early Saturday morning for Latacunga, a city several hours south of Quito. Once there we hopped onto another bus headed past Quilotoa, or so we thought. As is often the case when there is a language barrier, the shared understanding you have with someone is rarely as shared as you think . After a very, very bumpy two hours careening around corners and nearly going over the cliffs several times, we pulled into the small town of Zumbahua and were told to get off. Unfortunately, Lindsay had suffered a bad case of motion sickness during the journey (it was <em>not</em> pretty), so we thought we were being kicked off short of our destination for disturbing the passengers. </p>

<p>In reality, the bus just didn’t go all the way to Quilotoa, which we would have known had be bothered to read our guide books or do any sort of planning. We stood around scratching our heads, wondering “what now?”, for a total of 30 seconds before a local pounced offering to give us a ride in his truck for the modest (<em>cough cough</em>) fee of $6. We should have bargained, but we didn’t. </p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056124976"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-RLTSkp6/0/M/5854748129dae74d19b9o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hitching a ride in the back of a truck from Zumbahua to Quilotoa. This is Lindsay.</p>

<p>Jumping off the truck in Quilotoa we were greeted with the vista below. Quilotoa is located on the edge of a large crater lake. Eight hundred years ago the volcano here exploded violently, leaving this beautiful caldera lake. The locals say it is bottomless, but scientists put it at an astonishing 820 feet deep (almost as tall as the empire state building).</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056125010"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-NPtpx7F/0/M/585474833174967edb43o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>After eating some lunch and making sure Lindsay had recovered from the bus ride, we began the hike around the rim. Once again, had we done a little planning we would have known the rim was a much longer hike than it looked—a good five hours for fit hikers, which we were not. We started around two in the afternoon, confident we would make it back before dark. When six ‘o clock rolled around, we were barely 60% of the way around and the sun was rapidly disappearing behind the horizon.  We had been looking for the opportunity to camp, and thanks to our carelessness, we had stumbled right into it. </p>

<p>With darkness came the wind and cold. We made a fire, but it was hard won. The wind was fierce, the kindling wet, and good firewood scarce, though we had demonstrated our first ounce of forethought by collecting semi-dry branches while hiking once it became apparent we would not make it all the way around before dusk. Even with the wood, our prospects for a fire looked bleak and Lindsay began to doubt that I had ever been a Boy Scout. Using half a pack of travel tissues I was able to make the fire hot enough to ignite the branches. We enjoyed our canned tuna next to our sad little fire as you can see in the video below.</p>

<p>The next morning brought a cloudless sky and beautiful views of the countryside. We dismantled camp, spread and buried the remains of our fire (I’m happy to report we left no trace, aside from missing wood), and got back on the trail.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half into the remainder of the crater rim hike, we encountered a Fred and Thomas, a Swiss and German, hiking from Quilotoa to Chugchilán, a small village about a 4.5 hour hike away. They invited us to join them. Not having any concrete plans and unsure of what we would do once we made it back to the Quilotoa village, their invitation sounded like a good idea. </p>

<p>This leg of the trek was even better than the crater rim trail. The trail took us down the side of a mountain, across the valley in the middle, and up the other side to the town. The views were stunning! Along the way we encountered many locals making the trek themselves with produce or livestock in tow. At times we felt pretty stupid for puffing and sweating from exertion, and lugging our big packs around, while the locals whizzed along in perfect shape. </p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056126183"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-hqT7NvD/0/M/5854754883a9d063d5c0o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
From this point we hiked down (see trail on left/bottom), across the valley, and then back up to the town of Chugchilan 7.5 miles away.</p>

<p>We made it to to Chugchilán just as it started to rain. Exhausted and starving we sought out a meal in the town, but being Sunday most places were closed. A local hostel owner saw us as a ripe business opportunity, though I would like to think she just took pity on us, and opened her kitchen. After a simple but satisfying meal we thanked our host and politely refused the offer to stay at $16 per night. Instead we implored a local truck owner to drive us back to Zumbahua, where we could catch a proper bus to Latacunga and finally Quito. He wanted $40, which was $10 more than the usual rate, but we didn’t have much of a choice, and he knew it. While the driver happily fastened a tarp on the top of the truck, Thomas observed that the ride back along bumpy, unpaved roads in a rigid wooden truck-bed would be very uncomfortable. He recommended (in true German spirit) that we should buy a crate of beer to ease our suffering. We heartily agreed.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056126348"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-2hg4xn4/0/M/5855308242eaa9bc5f1fo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Exhausted, but full and slightly tipsy on our way back to Zumbahua</p>

<p>From Zumbahua it was straightforward getting buses back to Quito. That night, in my hostel bed, falling asleep to the sounds of car alarms and awful karaoke didn’t bother me as much as before. We’ll see how long it lasts. </p>

                    <p>The past couple weeks I have been hanging out with a local Ecuadorian named Ana. She’s originally from here in Quito, but is well traveled and speaks English quite well, though I try to to get by in Spanish as much as possible. Her best personality trait, and the reason I’m even writing this update on this topic, is just how friendly and open she is about sharing her country and culture. Case in point, after only hanging out twice she invited me to travel with her family on a day-trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujil%C3%AD">Pujili, Ecuador</a> (that’s <em>Poo-hi-li</em>) to watch the Corpus Christi Festival. Without her I wouldn’t have had this unforgettable experience, thanks Ana!</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-xBDtrP2/0/M/58733101108419497598o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Not such a flattering picture for the girl on the right, but I love this picture for the color.</p>

<p>The event is the Festival of Corpus Christi, a Catholic holiday here that <em>happens</em> to coincide with the traditional Inca holiday celebrating the Sun God. The main event is a <strong>long</strong> dancing parade, followed by loads of drinking and cockfights. It lasts all weekend, but unfortunately I could only visit on Saturday. People come from all over Ecuador, even Colombia and Bolivia, representing their local culture (both past and present) by dressing up in traditional dress and dancing in the parade. Allegedly, some of the costume and dancing styles date back to the Incas themselves, though I’m no historian, I just enjoy watching the myriad colors and differences in designs.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-Kbf4D2J/0/M/5872764501c2d6fe99eeo-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-2vKpP3k/0/M/58727638958f255fab1co-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
These two photos illustrate the large differences in regional style.</p>

<p>A recounting of this festival wouldn’t be complete without a mention of liquor, and in particular <em>my</em> experience with it. It is a custom among the parade-goers to <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056165044&amp;k=ndg6rm5&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">offer the dancers liquor</a> as they bounce by, which is all well and fine, though I suspect many of the dancers are quite smashed by the time they reach the end of the parade. <em>Another</em> custom is for those in the parade to offer liquor to the spectators, <a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056166395&amp;k=fk2x437&amp;lb=1&amp;s=M">usually from little plastic jugs</a> and a single shared shot glass. I have nothing against this custom, per se, as sharing your local brew is as important as sharing your costumes; however, there was some understood rule that <em>the gringos</em> <em>must</em> try <em>all</em> the liquor. I admit I don’t blend in particularly well in my REI rain-jacket, polyester pants, and, oh yea, my <strong>glowing white skin</strong>, but I tried to keep my back to the wall and observe as best I could (all my pictures were taken from the sidelines). Needless to say, once the fellows with the shot glasses got a lock on the gringo beacon, they made a beeline in our direction, arms outstretched, ready to pour some vile, burning liquid down our throats. After the third or fourth I was pretty much done, but to refuse was unthinkable, so I developed a routine to deal with the pain: smile, mutter “<em>salut</em>”, glug glug, grimace, yay!</p>

<p>As if the festivities were boring already, the locals thought of another way to liven things up: dance with the foreigners! At first I refused because I’m a horrible dancer–these were clearly professionals–and I wanted to keep playing my invisible observer role, or at least that’s what I was telling myself. In reality when you travel, you’re never invisible, and the locals have the same right to look at you as you do at them. In this case I wasn’t being harassed by the locals (even though that is how it felt at times), far from it indeed! They were simply being gracious hosts and trying to make the experience as fun for both of us as possible. Being drawn into the local culture, especially at their request, is special, and truth be told, it was disrespectful to sit there watching and taking pictures but refusing to get involved. “<em>I really don’t like dancing</em>”, I kept telling myself, but a crucial part of traveling is getting outside your comfort zone, something I had forgotten.</p>

<p>This post is part confession and part announcement. I need to come clean about a decision I’ve been wrestling with for months and decided weeks ago but have yet to share:</p>

<p><strong>I’m extending my trip indefinitely.</strong></p>

<p>For some of you this may not be much of a surprise, but I’ve decided to transition to a permanent traveling (<em>nomadic</em>, if you will) lifestyle. This trip to Ecuador is not a vacation or an after-graduation treat, rather it is the first step in a journey that will take me (I hope) around the world. It is the next stage in my life.</p>

<p>There are few professions that are location independent and can support perpetual travel. The traditional professions of nomads have been musicians, writers, teachers, and volunteers (i.e., those who exchange work for food/accommodation). However, the widespread adoption of the Internet and computing technology in general has given rise to another profession suited to a nomadic lifestyle: <em>the high-tech hobo</em>. </p>

<p>I am incredibly fortunate to have developed the necessary passion and skills necessary to support my wandering lifestyle, because I certainly don’t have what it takes to be a professional musician or writer. Teaching and volunteering are two occupations I plan to try someday, in fact sooner than you might think, but that is for another post. Whether I can succeed at this lifestyle is another question, one I’ve spent the last month trying to answer.</p>

<p>The past 6 weeks I used as a trial period to determine if I could actually work while traveling. I had serious doubts as to whether I could perform my duties with just a tiny netbook and random wifi hotspots. As a programmer you come to expect (and take for granted) certain luxuries, such as the workstation below I used for the last year until I graduated.</p>

<div class="caption">
<img alt="My old glass desk with two 24 inch computer monitors" src="/uploads/2011/07/desk-500.jpg" />
<p>Was this all really necessary?</p>
</div>

<p>If you asked me a year ago if I could work full-time with a 10 inch monitor instead of two 24 inch screens, I would have laughed you out of town.</p>

<p>Just several months ago I was shopping around for a fancy “programmer’s chair”. These ergonomic chairs are designed to serve the ‘eccentric’ needs of programmers and other working professionals who sit in front of a computer desk for hours and hours at a time. They cost upwards of a $1000! Not too long ago I was certain I <em>had</em> to have one of these chairs; I thought I couldn’t work fulltime without one.</p>

<p>Yet, for the past month I’ve been spending my working hours on couches, benches, bar stools, and bunk-beds. Yes, my backside hurts, my spine isn’t too happy, and my hands are cramped from using such a tiny keyboard, <strong>but I’m not trapped in an office or a cubicle</strong>. <em>That alone</em> is worth the pain.</p>

<div class="caption">
<img alt="A small plain wooden chair and desk" src="/uploads/2011/07/wood-desk-500.jpg" />
<p>My current work place. Fancy chairs, screens, and desks be damned!</p>
</div>

<p>Phew! There. It’s out. This was a difficult decision that has been long in the making. It involved sacrificing some other dreams, and in future posts I might discuss how I got to this point.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure what I am going to do once I tire of traveling, for I know it is not realistic to believe I’ll always be consumed with this wanderlust. Though, at this point I’m not planning that far ahead. I’ve been planning my whole life since I was 13 years old. Right now my plans extend as far the end of August when my Ecuador visa expires. After that, who knows? Colombia? Peru? Africa? I’ll worry about that when I get there.</p>

<p>Enough planning. Enough thinking. <strong>It’s time to live in the moment.</strong></p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apofica/4926676049/" title="2010 en Montañ (2) by Jorge Luis Perez, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4926676049_a068c8f2dc.jpg" width="500" alt="2010 en Montañ (2)" /></a></p>

<p>“But what if I want one of those ice-creams after I finish this?”, said my friend gesturing to her $1.50 hamburger.</p>

<p>“Then you can walk back to the town and get one”, responded my other friend matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>The first friend gazed with resentment at the 20m of soft sandy beach between her and the town, sighed, and lugubriously took a seat on the towel giving up on the ice-cream for the time being.</p>

<p>“You know,” started the second friend, <strong>“these aren’t real problems.”</strong></p>

<p>We laughed at the absurdity of getting in a huff over a short walk on a beautiful beach to an ice-cream vendor. Such is the lethargic lifestyle you slip into after a few days in a relaxing beach town.</p>

<p>Fast forward two days. Now we’re in a frantic dash through the town searching for the bus we booked 24 hours prior, but it has already left without us. We dawdled too long.</p>

<p>A public bus rolls up and a crowd of people rush toward it. Being in a pretty remote location along the coast of Ecuador, we know this bus might be our only chance to make it out tonight. In true Ecuadorian fashion we push and shove our way inside and claim 2 seats for ourselves. Even though I’m still barefoot I take one for the team and stand in the grimy, muddy aisle. </p>

<p>The bus pulls out into the night, and only then do we think to ask if it will drop us off anywhere near to where we need to be. We have 10pm tickets for our overnight bus from Libertad to Quito. It is 7:30pm, and with at least a 1.5hr ride from Montanita–though public buses are notorious for taking longer by taking frequent stops–we’ll be cutting it close.  We don’t even know where we need to go to catch our bus in Libertad.</p>

<p>A cockroach or two skitter across my feet, but I barely notice as I’m locked in struggle against gravity to keep my balance as the bus careens around black corners while crossing into the incoming lane. Meanwhile, worries are wheeling through my mind: <em>what’s</em> going to happen <em>if</em> we miss our bus? <em>What if</em> we can’t find the terminal? We all have work tomorrow morning, we’re probably going to miss it.</p>

<p>Arriving in an unfamiliar city at night with no plans for accommodation, much less a simple notion of where you are in the city is never a great idea. Given that this is Ecuador, the streets at night are most likely dangerous. Great!</p>

<p>The driver puts in a 90s dance mix, and the soul-searching strain of Haddaway’s “What is Love?” drifts above the raucous teenagers partying in the rear and the oppressive droning of the engine. </p>

<p>Haddaway's "What is Love" for your blog sing-along pleasure</p>
</div>

<p>As I begin to quietly sing along–<em>What is love?</em>–I mentally take a step back and laugh at the absurdity of the situation–<em>Oh baby, don’t hurt me</em>. Here I am, caught up in a huff about some minor transportation setbacks–<em>Don’t hurt me no more</em>–while on my way back from a luxurious beach getaway where I spent more in a weekend than people in the villages we’re driving past make in a two weeks.</p>

<p>The sage words of my friend suddenly coalesced in my mind:</p>

<blockquote><strong>These aren't real problems.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Throughout all my travels, I’ve yet to encounter a truly dire setback, and I think I’ve had my share of memorable obstacles: getting H1N1 in Egypt, ending up 8 hours off-course in remote eastern Turkey after a 12hr bus ride, taking sketchy private “taxis” at 1am from a Jordanian port.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/23/coming-out-so-to-speak.html">last post</a> I professed my desire to start framing my day-to-day life in the context of the moment, that is, I’ve resolved to put less emphasis on long term plans and issues. This is because I had let my perspective grow disproportionally large. There were so many goals and problems I was trying to court, that I simply felt overwhelmed. By contracting the scale of my outlook, I’ve been able to make my goals and problems manageable again. While I still believe this to be the right attitude for me to adopt, I am cognizant of the fact that I can’t become utterly consumed with the present lest I lose valuable perspective in the other direction.</p>

<p>Your problems can appear much more grievous and exigent than they would be if you placed them against the proper backdrop. Taking a mental step back and surrendering a little chuckle about your circumstances can make all the difference. </p>

<p>Back on the lurching bus, I bopped my head to Haddaway with a shit-eating grin on my face. We’d make it home, and if we didn’t, well, that would be another adventure. </p>

<p>Why hello there. It has been 82 days, since my last update, that is 2 months, 2 weeks and 6 days. Most of you surely know I’m not dead. Some of you may know I’m no longer in Ecuador. My excuse for not writing has been that since my camera was broken, I couldn’t possibly do any updates. After all, people come here for the pictures, not the words.</p>

<p>Yes, you, the reader,  should blame the malevolent horse who cruelly stepped on my camera, breaking it, and depriving you of my witty ramblings. Don’t blame me, the lazy author who couldn’t bother jotting down a few sentences once every couple weeks.</p>

<p>This blog serves two purposes. One is to keep my family and friends updated with my travels, which I’ve never been quite comfortable with. That entire premise reeks of ostentatiousness. The second purpose, also an overtly self-centered goal, is to practice writing, something I don’t get to do as often as I would like since graduating.</p>

<p>I’ve failed on both points. I’ll try and bring you up-to-date here by giving a quick update of the last two months, and I promise to keep the embellishments to a minimum.</p>

<p>In July I moved into an apartment in Quito, visited the beach, climbed some volcanoes, went rappelling, rafting, and made some great friends. In August I worked. A lot. My new roommates considered me some sort of antisocial monster who was allergic to sunlight and fresh air. August also saw me sharing goodbyes with some expat friends. Goodbyes are never fun.</p>

<p>September consisted of more work, though I did break through the hermit spell, and began socializing again. I even managed to do some camping and attempted to climb another volcano. I say attempt, because we were foiled by some wily fog. Future tip: double check the trail you’re embarking on is the trail that leads to your destination.</p>

<p>In some sappy metaphorical way, that hike through the fog turned out to be the impetus for my leaving Quito. More precisely, it was the conversation with my hiking partner that changed my course, though it took several weeks of mental incubation before I fully understood.</p>

<p>I had become stagnant in Quito. Reflecting on my time there, I can’t say what quelled my wanderlust. Was it Quito or Ecuador itself, the people I was hanging out with, or a little of both? Regardless, I enjoyed my time there immensely. The people, landscape, and, most importantly, my friends were captivating.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, after that conversation the familiar itch returned. It was time to move again; however, this time the itch felt different. Jumping across a border into new scenery wasn’t sufficient to scratch the itch. This time the itch demanded “<em>adventure</em>,” something risky and different. I blame my hiking friend for infecting me with this silly notion. Although, in fairness to her, I have always had a latent desire for the unknown and unexpected. It saddens me to say this, because it is a character flaw, but anything less than uncomfortable, unknown, and ambiguous tends to bore me.</p>

<p>The decision to leave Quito came suddenly. It was Saturday when I booked a flight on Monday. More goodbyes were had. They still aren’t fun.</p>

<p>So, now I am back stateside preparing for my next trip. More on that shortly.</p>

                    <p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/USA/First-Bike-Tour/25087660_2LRWDS"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/USA/First-Bike-Tour/i-VBDPMRd/0/M/6261287261bf8e030261o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
My bike packed up, ready for an adventure. Bring it on world.</p>

<p>When people ask me why I’m always moving about, I usually respond with some excuse I cook up on the spot. “<em>Oh, well I’m trying to figure out where I want to settle down.</em>” or “<em>I just enjoy the change in scenery.</em>” Both true, but not the ultimate cause responsible for my nomadic tendencies. That would be the itch. Also known as wanderlust, though I prefer the term ‘itch’ to ‘wanderlust’ as it captures the peculiar tingling or irritating feeling wanderlust induces.</p>

<p>In <a href="/2011/10/16/...and-we%27re-back.html" title="...and we're back!">my last update</a>, I mentioned that the itch that began growing in Ecuador expected something more than a change from now familiar surroundings. In addition to the tingling sense telling me to move on, another tingling required adventure. It is difficult to describe, but I knew simply jumping across borders would not satisfy this compulsion.</p>

<p>“<em>This is going to be awesome!</em>”, I thought to myself, “<em>I am going to do something legendary,and have great stories when it’s over.</em>”</p>

<p>And so I set out preparing an adventure. It was more impulse than careful consideration that ended in me choosing bicycle touring–long distance cycling–through South America as a great adventure. What could be more adventurous than powering myself, with my own two legs, through foreign lands, my ‘saddlebags’ packed full of my worldly possessions, prepared to handle whatever nature throws my way? I envisioned myself the next Amelia Earhart, Captain James Cook, or Lewis and Clark.</p>

<p>In the midst of my preparations (gear lists, spreadsheet budgets, route maps, etc.), that annoying side of my brain–you know, the one that pestered me into a Philosophy major–suddenly perked up with a perturbing question that stopped my planning cold:</p>

<p><strong>“But Casey, what <em>is</em> adventure?”</strong></p>

<p>Such a question might sound silly, but those of you who know the overly-analytical-me know right well that I have to answer these types of questions. After all, if I’m planning an adventure, I better have some inkling of what an adventure looks like. </p>

<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure" title="Adventure - Dictionary.com">The dictionary</a> is always a good place to start when you want to know what something <em>is</em>. </p>

<blockquote><strong>adventure</strong>: [...] <strong>3.</strong> a bold, usually risky undertaking; hazardous action of uncertain outcome.</blockquote>

<p>Seems to be pretty intuitive, no? An adventure isn’t just a risky undertaking, it is a <em>bold</em> risky undertaking, otherwise we wouldn’t admire it as an adventure, but, rather, disdain it as a foolish or reckless undertaking. The second part of the definition also has a certain semantic charm, for who would describe a hazardous action of <em>known</em> outcome as adventurous? Walking in front of a bus is by most accounts hazardous, but hardly an adventure.</p>

<p>So, we have a simple rubric to determine if an activity can be considered an adventure or not: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Is it bold?</li>
  <li>Is it risky?</li>
  <li>Is it of uncertain outcome?</li>
</ol>

<p>Huzzah! My bicycle touring plans surely satisfied these three criteria, which should have satisfied that pesky brain. I should have been able to return to the fun questions, such as, “how much water should I carry?” or “should I pack instant coffee or a portable coffee maker?” Unfortunately, that was not the end of my ruminations over adventure. </p>

<p>There I was surrounded on one metaphorical side by route maps, budget spreadsheets, guidebooks, and bicycle touring blogs, while on the other side loomed the image of adventure placed upon a pedestal, casting its disapproving shadow over the whole lot. How could I possibly claim to be planning an adventure, when every minutiae is carefully considered? </p>

<p>Every centimeter of our little blue-green ball has been scanned and photographed by metal marvels in space. That footage has been analyzed and dumped into your cellphone. Your universally accepted plastic card is a key usable in one of those magic street-side contraptions that spits out money wherever you are (unless it is Discover). Pervasive global communication has annihilated the concept of distance. Using Skype you can wish your dear mum in Boston happy birthday no matter if you’re in Buffalo, Bangalore, or Beijing.</p>

<p>Not to mention those packaged guidebooks detailing every conceivable tourist destination, with precise street maps, and convenient accommodation reviews in 3 lines or less. Gone are the days of loading out your dog sled train with salt pork, a bushel of apples, and a cask of ale, then heading out into the great white unknown. Between books, e-books, blogs, travel websites, travel magazines, podcasts, and Internet forums, nearly everything you could want to do has not only been done, but been documented in detail online.</p>

<div class="caption">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsteviesees/5197141917/" title="Bearded Man by Stevie Benintende, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5197141917_f2cc0c1b5f.jpg" width="500" alt="Bearded Man" /></a>
<p>"<em>There's no adventure left in the world! It's all used up.</em>", cries the old grizzly man.</p>
</div>

<p>All these sources remove the boldness and uncertainty from the equation. You can learn everything there is to know about a trip or destination by reading what others have done without even leaving your home. Moreover, the mere fact that countless people before you have trekked that trail, seen those ruins, or ridden through that country and then blogged about it, makes that undertaking decidedly less bold.</p>

<p>You’re left, then, with just a risky undertaking, but even the risk is tempered by the torrent of information available on the Internet and in books. Every potential mishap can be identified and countered. All that remains is an undertaking, and there’s nothing particularly meaningful or exciting about undertakings. Popping down the street to buy some milk is an undertaking. Hopping onto a plane to the Pyramids is an undertaking. In this light, how is independent travel all that different from mainstream packaged tours? Is travel ever really an adventure in this modern era?</p>

<p>Where does that leave us wanna-be adventurers? Compared to the famous explorers and adventurers, we’re hardly doing anything more exciting than visiting a neighboring town that is more or less the same as ours. Thank you globalization!</p>

<p>Just how much good ol’ adventure is left in the world? If there is any, where and what is it?</p>

<p>This sort of thought isn’t healthy, and I don’t buy into these conclusions. I need to stop these romantic comparisons to famous explorers; it is unfair to ourselves and even disrespectful to their legacy. Adventure still abounds. Achieving it just might take a bit more effort, particularly when it comes to ignoring those modern conveniences that can spoil our adventure with foreknowledge.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said for personal adventure, that is adventure framed in your own personal experience. If you’ve never left your home country, then taking a packaged tour or cruise is definitely an adventure. Hell, for me, navigating the mall during the holiday season can be as much an adventure as climbing volcanoes in the Andes.</p>

<p>Adventure is everywhere, but recognizing it requires a shift in perspective. The English writer G.K. Chesterton eloquently puts this sentiment into words: </p>

<blockquote><p>An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.</p><p>&#8212;G.K. Chesterton</p></blockquote>

<p>Take that pesky brain! Adventure is that which puts me outside my comfort zone. It doesn’t matter if I’ve got a cellphone in my pocket, a guidebook in my pack, and a credit card in my wallet, if I’m pumping 60lbs of bike and gear up an Andean slope, or through a Peruvian desert, by golly, I’m having an adventure.</p>

<p>I encourage you to find <em>your</em> adventure wherever it may be.</p>
