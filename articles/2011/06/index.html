                    <p>Solo traveling is an inherently complicated and risky endeavor. A foreigner wandering city streets alone makes an inviting quarry for street toughs and petty thieves. Even something simple as going to the bathroom when in a restaurant or cafe becomes difficult as the solitary traveler has no one to watch their things or their back.</p>

<p><a title="Solo Traveler by Sparky_R, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkys_pics/3381805319/"><img alt="Solo Traveler" height="353" width="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3381805319_e397d5d84f.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>On the other hand traveling unaccompanied is an immensely rewarding experience. The fewer number of people in a group, the easier it is to make decisions, and believe me when I say that decision making can paralyze a group and turn a would-be fun day (or trip!) into one remembered only for the arguments and amount of grief shared by all. When you are a group of one, the task of deciding where to eat, what to visit, how long to stay, etc., is completely up to your taste and inclinations. To travel with others often involves sacrificing self autonomy for group think, something I&#8217;m not particularly keen on. When alone you can follow your feelings and instincts without having to put them into words to convince a partner.</p>

<p>Before this update devolves into a treatise on solo travel, I want to share a recent story that came about because I was traveling alone.</p>

<p>Last Saturday morning at my hostel in Quito, Ecuador I was sipping my coffee and tallying the previous day&#8217;s expenses in my little black notebook when a tall gringo walked in and busied himself with making a breakfast of toast and juice. </p>

<p>The breakfast room is a great location for meeting fellow travelers. Swapping backgrounds and tales of adventures over a steaming cup of café is great way to shake of the morning grogginess. This swapping started of as most do: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Casey. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? How long are you traveling? Why <em>&lt;insert current location&gt;</em>?&#8221;. The tall gringo turned out to be a fellow named Mike from Pennsylvania who had volunteered with low-income families and kids here in Quito for 2 years about 15 years ago. He comes back every year for 10 days to visit the kids (who&#8217;ve grown up) and various friends.</p>

<p>Anyway, we swapped our plans for the weekend. Mine were pretty boring. This particular weekend in Quito was a holiday, so everything was shuttered and the streets were empty as people left for the beaches or countryside. I planned to stay inside and read a book, do some work, etc. As it turned out Mike was behaving like a local; and getting out of town. He had an old college (U Penn) friend who owns a Hacienda about 45 minutes out of Quito. Mike planned to spend weekend at the Hacienda visiting his friend&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>What happened next only occurred because I was traveling solo. After hearing and politely praising (but feeling inwardly jealous) Mike&#8217;s plans, he suddenly asked if I would like to accompany him. I suppose he took pity on my meager weekend plans. </p>

<p>Accepting the offer was risky, with out a doubt, for I did not know this man inviting me out into the countryside, but it was simply too good to pass up. The proposition was surreal: accompany him by taxi (for free) to the Hacienda, eat dinner with the family (for free), sleep in one of the many guest rooms (for free), take two more meals (for free), and relax all Sunday on the estate&#8217;s grounds. Had I booked a similar trip through proper channels I would have paid upwards of $500, and that wouldn&#8217;t have included the quality time with an Ecuadorian family.</p>

<p>Long story short, I went! It was utterly fantastic!</p>

<a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/25087727_6tJhzK#!i=2056136129&k=G3VTrQ2&lb=1&s=A" title="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front."><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/i-G3VTrQ2/0/M/577854767065e0cbb4cao-M.jpg" title="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front." alt="Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front."></a>

<p>I took quite a few pictures of the estate&#8217;s grounds, though I shied away from taking many inside as I didn&#8217;t want to come across as a nosy outsider photographing the private sanctum of this family&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The photos are pretty self explanatory. All in all it was a great experience getting a peek into Ecuadorian family life. Admittedly, this family is in the extreme upper class (they have live in servants), so the peek wasn&#8217;t representative of Ecuadorian life, nonetheless it was a unique experience.</p>

<p>Had I been in a group, I never would have been invited into this family&#8217;s home. Chalk one up to solo travel.</p>

<p>This is a baked Guinea Pig, known is Spanish as <em>Cuy</em> (Koo-ee), prepared in the traditional Ecuadorian fashion.</p>

<p>The texture is quite like that of roasted chicken, but the flavor is decidedly porkish. The skin is very thick and (in my opinion) quite gross, not at all like the nice crispy skin of a chicken or juicy fat chunks from a beef steak.</p>

                    <p>I took a day trip from Quito to the equator (from which Ecuador takes its name) with a very friendly British couple (Lewis and Sara). </p>

<div class='stb-images_box' style="text-align:center"><a title="Ecuador: Middle of the World" href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Middle-of-the-World/25087816_385sxd">Click here to view all photos</a></div>

<p>Apparently the equator makes it possible (or easier) to balance an egg, because of the opposing forces. In fact, the guide claimed all sorts of things are different at the equator: our weight, our strength, the direction water spirals, etc. I&#8217;m quite skeptical of all these claims, though I did manage to balance an egg on a nail.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, they are just tiny little mosquito bites. I have been assured that aside from itching like heck (they are called fire mosquitos), the bites and spots are perfectly harmless. They are a small price to pay for the experience of camping in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest far removed from civilization.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll post more pictures and a story or two about the trip soon.</p>

                    <p>I spent 3 nights and 4 days deep in the Amazon Jungle. It was unforgettable.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi27gr0qs1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>The trip started with an 8 hour overnight bus ride from Quito (where I&#8217;m based in Ecuador) to the small oil city of Lago Agrio close to the Colombian border. This was my first extended bus ride in Ecuador. Going in I was wary, as I had heard several scary stories about Ecuadorian buses. For the most part I was worried about scams and ruses to separate me from (and then run off with) my bag. For example, a common ruse is to use a pretty girl or friendly face to distract you while a partner reaches under your chair (from the chair behind yours) and steals stuff from your bag (or takes the whole thing). Thankfully I didn&#8217;t have any problems aside from not getting much sleep. I placed my bag on the floor between my feet, and was so wary that every little bump or sway caused me to jerk awake in alarm.</p>

<p>The bus arrived in Lago Agrio at the fresh hour of 7am. Being the stubborn and stingy type, I refused to take a $1.00 taxi to the prescribed meeting point (a hotel in the center of town). Instead, I used the little map the travel agent had given me to walk there, after all, the map made it appear that the hotel was a mere 5-6 blocks away. After wandering through mostly poor and fairly sketchy neighborhoods for 20 minutes, it became clear the map was more of a conceptual guide (e.g., the hotel is down and left from the bus station) than a navigational aid (e.g., walk one block on Luis street, then turn right on &#8230; etc).</p>

<p>Using my fledgling Spanish (&#8220;Dónde <em>&lt;some street name&gt;?&#8221;</em>), I sought directions from the locals. As is apparently typical of small Ecuadorian cities, none of the streets were signed and few locals even knew their names! I did happen across a few knowledgeable and helpful locals who gave what I suppose were decent directions in Spanish, but, of course, I couldn&#8217;t understand them. In the end hand frantic hand waving saved the day.</p>

<p>From this experience I have developed this short</p>

<p><strong>Dictionary of Hand Waving Directions:</strong></p>

<ul><li>one wave in a direction and a tilt of the head = <em>&#8220;should I go this way?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>one wave in a direction and nod = <em>&#8220;that way is probably right. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but don&#8217;t want to be embarrassed.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>using two hands (in clapping position) to show distance = <em>&#8220;how far should I go?&#8221;</em></li>

<li>strong multiple waves in a direction = <em>&#8220;go a long way!&#8221;</em> (or, maybe,<em> &#8220;get out of here!&#8221;</em>)</li>

</ul><p>I finally stumbled upon the hotel, because I noticed several gringos lounging in chairs and sipping coffee out front. I hadn&#8217;t seen one gringo during my trek, so I figured these ones must be on to something. Even the hotel lacked clear signage!</p>

<p>The gringos were in fact waiting for the same jungle expedition as I, so I joined them for a simple breakfast of coffee and eggs (literally, just coffee and eggs. There was no salt, pepper, hot sauce, fruit, or bread). The group consisted of me, the token American, a 30-ish Swiss accountant, a 20-something French woman, and two 20-something Canadian sisters (Geological engineer and nurse).</p>

<p>We busied ourselves with food and introductory conversation. I would become fairly well acquainted with these gringos over the next 4 days, for we were all in the same group. We ate, slept, explored, and almost literally (explanation forthcoming) showered together. Of course, at this point in the story we didn&#8217;t know any of these things.</p>

<p>9:00&#160;o&#8217; clock rolled around and our transportation arrived. </p>

<p>The next leg of the journey was yet another bus ride. This time in a smaller bus and a length of only 2 and a half hours. With a quick pit stop at the airport to pick up two more Americans (a father and 19 yr-old son), we blasted off onto a narrow, winding road into the country. As we progressed the landscape transformed from generic temperate green surroundings into exotic leafy, viney jungle. Unfortunately, I missed most of this transformation because buses put me to sleep. </p>

<p>When I awoke we had pulled off the road and up to the edge of a river where a very long, narrow boat was waiting for us. We hustled out of the bus and loaded our belongings into the front of the boat, then donned very stinky and ill-fitting life jackets. I suspect the life-jackets were a formality of sorts whilst we were in site of the national park rangers manning the shack where we paid our $1.00 entrance fee. This was to be the only boat ride (of which we had many) where we wore life jackets.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi1tp2umT1qzc5xr.jpg"/></p>

<p>Excited, talkative, and smelling of jungle mold, we boarded the boat two by two. Our boat driver gave the outboard motor a quick pull, the engine roared to life, and we were off! As we navigated away from the bank, I gave a quick look over my shoulder and said goodbye to civilization. Where we were headed there would be no roads: deep into the Amazon jungle.</p>

<p><em>(It would appear I am somewhat wordy. 700 words in and I&#8217;ve only just gotten to the jungle bit, so I am going to split this trip across multiple posts. Check back in a day or two for the sequel.)</em></p>

<p>After reading this article (<a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN0522204620110606">Ecuador’s Yasuni jungle protection plan</a>) by Reuters I couldn’t help but get the impression that Ecuador is ransoming its rainforest.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s not quite what the article says, but reading between the lines I certainly get the impression that Ecuador is telling the world “<em>Hey World! Give us a bunch of money or we’ll destroy this <a href="http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=ECU+02&amp;mode=all">UNESCO protected</a> nature reserve.</em>”</p>

<p>I’m not exactly an environmental activist (or oil advocate either), but this route seems pretty low. This stunt will allow Ecuador to blame everyone else but themselves if they have to start oil extraction in the rainforest.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Ecuador is morally in the clear?</strong></p>

                    <p>When <a title="An Amazon Expedition (part 1)" href="http://elusivetruth.net/post/6339375909/an-amazon-expedition-part-1">I last left the story</a> of my Amazon trip, my new friends and I had boarded a canoe <!--END-->and   headed into the Amazon Rainforest. The area we were headed into is called the Cuyabeno, a   portion of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. The Cuyabeno is a series of interconnected   lakes, lagoons, rivers, and floating forests that eventually drains into the Amazon River.   It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the world.</p>

<p>Enough with the book facts. <em>What did we do there? </em>I had trouble writing this update, as there was simply so much involved in this trip. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to give the reader a peek into the experience we had in the rainforest. Rather than gloss it over with a jazzy narrative or a play-by-play of each day, I am going to include a few photos of memorable moments. </p>

<p>We went on jungle hikes, where our guide used natural ingredients to create a stomach   soothing concoction for Oli (the one with the hat).

<p>We went fishing for and caught red-bellied piraña.

<p>We saw giant spiders, snakes, cockroaches, and other giant bugs straight out of a horror   film.

<p>We went swimming in the gorgeous lagoons.

</p>

<p>After swimming, we silently watched the brilliant sun set over the forest teeming with the   sound of life.

</p>

<p>We ate, slept and showered in thatched wooden huts on stilts.

</p>

<p>We laughed and played cards by candle light. We shared a miserable rainy jungle trek, and   bonded over hours of grueling paddling. </p>

<p>My words can&#8217;t begin to describe all that went into the experience. The photos can do a slightly better job, but so much of the experience was un-capturable by camera. In the end, the total experience is a only a shared memory of those seven people you see above, which is a special, yet at the same time a somber fact. We came together for a short time, strangers from all over the world, shared intense and unforgettable moments, and then scattered back into the wind.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>For the past several weeks I’ve essentially been living in Quito, Ecuador. Most people would probably disagree that I’m ‘living’ here, after all, I’ve only been here four weeks. While I don’t claim to know Quito particularly well, it certainly feels like I’m living here. For me, ‘living’ someplace implies a routine or a certain regularity to your activities. ‘Traveling’ suggests just the opposite. Travelers rarely do the same thing more than once in the same location. For example, I walk the same way to Spanish lessons every day, frequent the same grocery store, and grab an espresso at the same cafe. Travelers might do some of those things, but it would be exceptional for one to make a repeat visit. Whereas, I have fallen into a predictable routine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wake up around 6:30 am</li>
  <li>Coffee until 7am</li>
  <li>Work until 9am</li>
  <li>Spanish Lessons until 1pm</li>
  <li>Work until 6 or 7pm</li>
  <li>Drinks with a local or foreigner</li>
  <li>In bed by 11 pm</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, ‘living’ some place involves a sense of permanency that I don’t associate with my stay here in Quito. When people ask why I am in Quito I answer “learning Spanish”; I’m not here to work and I’m not merely here to see the tourist attractions. Quito is an interesting city, and I really enjoy getting to know her and her people, but I won’t stay forever. Being here on a tourist visa places a hard limit on the length of time I can be in Ecuador. Even if I choose to renew my visa for another three months, I won’t spend the entire duration in Quito.</p>

<p>Another indication that I’m living in Quito, or at least begun to tire of my routine, is how agitated I felt last week with the desire to escape the city for several days. While the noise, traffic, and pollution in Quito aren’t near as bad as Cairo (where I lived for a year), they do take a toll on your mental state.</p>

(by Guillaume Lavaure on Flickr)</p></div>

<p>On Thursday I decided I wanted to get out, so I began a semi-frantic search for somewhere to go. Via this great site called <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> (a facebook-esque site for travelers—I’ll write more about it at some point), I met an American named Lindsay. She had a tent and the same itch to escape our urban confinement. We made our plans on Friday: check out a region high in the Andes mountains called Quilotoa, hike around, and camp somewhere if possible.</p>

<p>We had no clue if camping was a possible, apparently camping isn’t a popular activity in Ecuador. Optimistic that we would figure it out, we hopped on a bus early Saturday morning for Latacunga, a city several hours south of Quito. Once there we hopped onto another bus headed past Quilotoa, or so we thought. As is often the case when there is a language barrier, the shared understanding you have with someone is rarely as shared as you think . After a very, very bumpy two hours careening around corners and nearly going over the cliffs several times, we pulled into the small town of Zumbahua and were told to get off. Unfortunately, Lindsay had suffered a bad case of motion sickness during the journey (it was <em>not</em> pretty), so we thought we were being kicked off short of our destination for disturbing the passengers. </p>

<p>In reality, the bus just didn’t go all the way to Quilotoa, which we would have known had be bothered to read our guide books or do any sort of planning. We stood around scratching our heads, wondering “what now?”, for a total of 30 seconds before a local pounced offering to give us a ride in his truck for the modest (<em>cough cough</em>) fee of $6. We should have bargained, but we didn’t. </p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056124976"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-RLTSkp6/0/M/5854748129dae74d19b9o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hitching a ride in the back of a truck from Zumbahua to Quilotoa. This is Lindsay.</p>

<p>Jumping off the truck in Quilotoa we were greeted with the vista below. Quilotoa is located on the edge of a large crater lake. Eight hundred years ago the volcano here exploded violently, leaving this beautiful caldera lake. The locals say it is bottomless, but scientists put it at an astonishing 820 feet deep (almost as tall as the empire state building).</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056125010"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-NPtpx7F/0/M/585474833174967edb43o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>After eating some lunch and making sure Lindsay had recovered from the bus ride, we began the hike around the rim. Once again, had we done a little planning we would have known the rim was a much longer hike than it looked—a good five hours for fit hikers, which we were not. We started around two in the afternoon, confident we would make it back before dark. When six ‘o clock rolled around, we were barely 60% of the way around and the sun was rapidly disappearing behind the horizon.  We had been looking for the opportunity to camp, and thanks to our carelessness, we had stumbled right into it. </p>

<p>With darkness came the wind and cold. We made a fire, but it was hard won. The wind was fierce, the kindling wet, and good firewood scarce, though we had demonstrated our first ounce of forethought by collecting semi-dry branches while hiking once it became apparent we would not make it all the way around before dusk. Even with the wood, our prospects for a fire looked bleak and Lindsay began to doubt that I had ever been a Boy Scout. Using half a pack of travel tissues I was able to make the fire hot enough to ignite the branches. We enjoyed our canned tuna next to our sad little fire as you can see in the video below.</p>

<p>The next morning brought a cloudless sky and beautiful views of the countryside. We dismantled camp, spread and buried the remains of our fire (I’m happy to report we left no trace, aside from missing wood), and got back on the trail.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half into the remainder of the crater rim hike, we encountered a Fred and Thomas, a Swiss and German, hiking from Quilotoa to Chugchilán, a small village about a 4.5 hour hike away. They invited us to join them. Not having any concrete plans and unsure of what we would do once we made it back to the Quilotoa village, their invitation sounded like a good idea. </p>

<p>This leg of the trek was even better than the crater rim trail. The trail took us down the side of a mountain, across the valley in the middle, and up the other side to the town. The views were stunning! Along the way we encountered many locals making the trek themselves with produce or livestock in tow. At times we felt pretty stupid for puffing and sweating from exertion, and lugging our big packs around, while the locals whizzed along in perfect shape. </p>

<p class="caption"><a href="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056126183"><img src="http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-hqT7NvD/0/M/5854754883a9d063d5c0o-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>
From this point we hiked down (see trail on left/bottom), across the valley, and then back up to the town of Chugchilan 7.5 miles away.</p>

<p>We made it to to Chugchilán just as it started to rain. Exhausted and starving we sought out a meal in the town, but being Sunday most places were closed. A local hostel owner saw us as a ripe business opportunity, though I would like to think she just took pity on us, and opened her kitchen. After a simple but satisfying meal we thanked our host and politely refused the offer to stay at $16 per night. Instead we implored a local truck owner to drive us back to Zumbahua, where we could catch a proper bus to Latacunga and finally Quito. He wanted $40, which was $10 more than the usual rate, but we didn’t have much of a choice, and he knew it. While the driver happily fastened a tarp on the top of the truck, Thomas observed that the ride back along bumpy, unpaved roads in a rigid wooden truck-bed would be very uncomfortable. He recommended (in true German spirit) that we should buy a crate of beer to ease our suffering. We heartily agreed.</p>
