I'm counting the number of nights I spend camping vs "couch surfing" vs in a
proper bed (*couch surfing* is just a catch all when I'm crashing indoors, not
in a bed). Trite, I know, but it's a fun game to play. So far the tally is 5
camping, 3 couch, 0 bed.

Translating memories to words is like creating chicking nuggets from a chicken.

You start with a whole chicken, full of life and feathers, in a complex social
dynamic with roosters, older hens, and little chicks caught up in a dramatic
quest for seeds and bugs.

What comes out looks something like this.

Even after dressing it up a little, it's palatable, but nothing like it's
former strutting and scratching self.

but then the memory fades and all you're left with is the nugget.

### How did this happen?

Not just a few weeks ago, this announcement would have been completely
different. I had planned to cycle across the North African coast from Egypt to
Morocco. Alas, my attempts to acquire an Algerian and Libyan visa for
subsequent bicycle travel were unsuccessful.

The visa obtainment objective had taken me from Cairo to Tunis. I was
frustrated. My plans had been foiled because some humans drew a line in the
sand and called themselves different from the humans on the other side. Of
course, the only reason I'm able to have this complaint is I was lucky enough
to be born on the particular side of a line that allows me to trot the globe
generally ignoring those pitiful little lines.

Somewhere over the preceding months I had made a goal to eschew air travel if
at all possible. I firmly believe shuttling about in a metal tube is not
travel, it is teleportation.

The only land routes out of Tunisia are through Libya or Algeria, two countries
I couldn't enter. I felt trapped. Worse, the wanderlust had returned with
a biting fervor. I use to consider the restlessness that came with prolonged
stagnation an itch, a desire. 

<blockquote>
An urge builds in me, a voice in one everlasting whisper, day and night
repeated until I just have to go. It doesnâ€™t really matter where I go. All that
matters is that I go.
