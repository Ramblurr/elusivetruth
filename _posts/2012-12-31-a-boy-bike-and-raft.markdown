I've never been one for New Years resolutions. Maybe this is because I could
never get past the arbitrary demarcation of a "new year", or perhaps
I subconsciously believe I don't need improvement (more likely, I'm privately afraid to
fail).

Keeping with such anti-resolution tradition, the goal I'm about to describe is
decidedly not a New Years resolution. Nevertheless, it is nearly 2013 and
I have a goal.

### I am going to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea using only human powered amphibious travel


Specifically, I am going to follow the inland waterways along the rivers Rhine,
Main, and Danube across Europe, and because I apparently harbor some (not-so)
latent masochistic tendencies I'll be doing this **during winter**, that is,
starting tomorrow.

I'll be journeying by bicycle and packraft. A packraft is an inflatable
dinghy-style craft that is quite light and paddled like a kayak. I packrafted
for the first time on Christmas Day this year after buying my floating blue transport
(pictured below).

There's something about human-powered travel I find indelibly attractive.
Applying a bit of sweat and wit to traverse long distances is my
little rebellion against this machine dominated world of automation and
instant gratification.

Now, self-supported *amphibious* human-powered transport, hah! What a notion!
Water and land. Suddenly those blue squiggles on a map aren't an annoying
obstruction.

### The Plan & Difficulties

The plan is quite simple: *follow the skinny water east until I arrive at the big
water.*

I'm not one for elaborate preparation, in fact, all I've really done to prepare
for this journey is buy the packraft and relevant water gear (paddle, drysuit,
etc), and some extra cold weather clothes. Traveling with a full camping
kit has become standard practice for me.

This is my first European winter, so we'll see how I fair. I will certainly
encounter snow in Germany, and I can't imagine the paths along the River are
high priority for the snow plows.

Wikipedia informed me that the Rhine flows from Switzerland towards the
Atlantic, which means I'll be peddling along shore upstream until I hit the
Danube. From the Danube I'll blow up the raft and paddle onwards. I'll buy river
maps in each country as I go.

Having a contingency plan for every possible hurdle is antithetical to my idea
of adventure. Now, this is Europe after all, a highly populated area. I expect my most
arduous challenges will be finding rural camping spots (I hope to eat these words).

Name suggestions for my bike and boat are welcome. At the moment I'm considering "Solace"
and "Solitude" respectively.
