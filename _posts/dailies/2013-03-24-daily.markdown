**From**: Main-Danube Canal, Germany (23 March, 2013)

Finding a camping spot last night was tough. Rode past beautiful forests and
fields all day, but when dusk came the land was either all tilled earth
*(sure sign spring is coming if the farmers are out ripping up my tenting sites)*,
thickets of prickly brambles, or soft comfy grass but all
angled at a gut-wrenching 45 degrees!

Over an hour I rolled on through the dark, jerking over every moon-shadowed
pothole in the uneven dirt path until it dead ended in a cul-de-sac surrounded
by water.  I had taken a wrong turn into a tiny peninsula jutting into the
canal.  But what a dead end it was, anything but dead to my tired eyes, the
first flat stretch of even earth I'd seen for miles. The moonlight bathed it in
an enchanting glow and I half expected fairies to jump out and proclaim me
their king, or lull me into a sleep from which I'd awake their captive.

I laid out my ground cloth and sleeping bag dispensing with the tent entirely.
Consumed with that singular sensation of bliss earned through great exhaustion
I unfolded tired limbs onto my pad and stared bleary eyed into the infinite
depths of the Milky Way. Whatever thoughts were trickling through my head are
long gone, whisked into the heavens by a wintry zephyr and the deep soulful
rumblings of the river barges as they trundled past.

<p>This gentle patch of earth might not look like much, but it was home for a night.</p>

Today I made it to Regensberg! Significant, because it means I've joined
the Danube. I'll paddle this river until it empties into the Black Sea, some
1500 miles and 8 countries from here. I embark on my raft Monday.
