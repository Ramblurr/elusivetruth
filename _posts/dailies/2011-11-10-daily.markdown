**From:** Loja, Ecuador

Early morning in the little village of Oña. As much as I would like to roll out
of bed into my bike and down the road, I'm a slave to little morning rituals,
mostly involving coffee. This morning was no exception. Made some coffee in my
stove outside the Hotel, and shared a few cups with the owner, Antonio.

He was interested in my travels, mainly concerning what my family thought about
me traveling alone. We had an interesting discussion about the differences
between American and Ecuadorian culture regarding the importance of family. He
was quite surprised that I was one of only two children. His old face, gouged
and cracked from a lifetime of hard work, split into a wide, proud grin as he
exclaimed that he had had 8 sons and 2 daughters.

As I packed up my bike with its four panniers (bike bags) on each wheel, he watched intently
from the driveway. Giving me an astonished look, he asked how I stored my computers in such little space. The night before I had told him I was a *ingeniero sistemas* ('computer engineer', sort of), and he had taken that to mean I sold computers (like a traveling computer salesman). I attempted to explain that I didn't sell anything physical, but rather sold this immaterial substance called 'software'. Nodding heavily as if he was beginning to grasp the concept, he delicately asked if he could see some of this 'software' and wondered where I sold it. Unfortunately, my Spanish was just not up to the task of explaining that I sold intangible, invisible items at a phantasmic global market called the 'Internet.' I expect that would be difficult even in English.

Hit the road around 8am for the second leg of the journey from
Cuenca to Loja. The weather was kinder today, blue skies with puffy white
clouds covered me most of the day providing some gorgeous vistas.

Elevation change was more extreme than yesterday. I lost count of the number of
passes traversed. The day was a series of long, sustained climbs, followed by exhilarating, but oh so short, descents through windy mountain roads.

*Gravity giveth, and gravity taketh away.*

Riding in mountainous terrain has made me realize that patience and a steely
resolve are crucial when overcoming obstacles. With sufficient patience and
determination, I feel like I could do anything.

Stopped in the small town of Saraguro for lunch. Rice, beans, and chicken:
standard Ecuadorian fare. Can't wait for Peru, if just for a change in food.

Near dusk, fog settled in. By that time I had been riding for about 9 hours and was thoroughly fatigued. Fog riding is mentally taxing. There is the extra attention that 
must be paid to vehicles and obstacles, yet more onerous is the visual
deprivation. You lose the sensation of progress, of forward movement.

Determined to reach Loja today, I rode into dark (in retrospect, not particularly smart). If fog riding in daylight is mentally taxing, doing the same but in darkness is punishing.

I rode for what seemed liked hours into the impenetrable blackness. I pulled out every mental trick I knew to force my legs to keep pumping and hands to keep gripping, until all thought fled and only raw instinctual movement remained.

It was a mindless toil.

The white line was the only thing visible, a barely perceptible beacon of hope promising a way out of the void that had swallowed me. Dutifully, I followed.

And then, in a quiet moment--indistinguishable from those just passed--I road out of the murky vapor into a nocturnal mountainside. Beneath me, bathed in a purple light diffused through the mist, was the city.

There was an immense sigh that shuddered throughout everything. In that moment I found myself--but the sigh spent itself, the moment passed, and silence reigned.

I pointed my bike downhill and the silence was spoiled by the soft sound of
cool wind.
