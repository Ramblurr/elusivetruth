I'm currently some 30,000+ feet (9,000+ m) over the Atlantic on my *22nd plane* in 4 months.

Now, in this post I'm going to come off as a spoiled brat, but, after all, it is my journal. I reserve
the right to rant occasionally.

I'm sick of airplanes. Moving about in an airplane is not travel.

...except in our great nation we prefer molestation. Straight up, full on.

When it's my turn for the hallowed ritual (and it's *always* my turn),
I choose to assert my right to receive my back-handed fondle in public, rather
then slink away to the private room.

It's just my modest contribution to the absurdity of our [security theater][theater]:
making the polite TSA agent cup my balls in public. *Yes, that's right
everyone! Look over here, this fellow's job is to give me a firm rubdown in
front of your kids.*

Ahem.

State sponsored groping is not what I set about to journal when I began with
the title "Flying is not travel," but the flight attendants are serving dinner
and I have become quite worked up over a little friskiness.

Going to tuck the pen and notebook into the seat-back pocket and return to the
thought of "flying as travel" later.
