Finally dragged myself out of Puerto Lopez today. Five (six? I lost count) days
there was way more than I should have spent. Though, the combination of people,
sun, sand, and ocean was just too difficult to decline.

Bought a bracelet from one of the artesanias. It has my alma mater's colors,
which is probably why it caught my eye, because my school spirit isn't particularly fierce. A little token for remembering, something I'm also usually not so keen on.

It was well past 2pm when I started the ascent out of town up that big hill
to the south I had been eyeing all week.

After that hill I didn't expect to make it far,
especially because of a small mountain pass about 20mi away. Surprisingly,
despite the fact my legs turned to flub after 5 days of beach living, I made it
a solid 40mi, well past the mountain pass. No pictures from that giant uphill
ride. Buses cutting into the nonexistent shoulder and savage dogs
attempting to take chunks from my calves, didn't leave much opportunity for
photographs.

Road about an hour into dark. First time night riding in Ecuador, wouldn't
recommend it. There weren't any suitable wild camping spots, so I road along in
my red and white blinking glory until I chanced upon a small *hosteria* in
Colonche. They didn't have any rooms, but *la senora* graciously allowed me to setup my tent in an open space out front. For free! Tuna fish with mayonnaise for dinner.
