**From:** Vilcabamba, Ecuador

After three weeks of biking along the sun-drenched coast of Ecuador, sucking
down coconut juice freshly freed from the husk by overly eager men with
machetes, following around cute and intriguing *artesanias*, and camping along
sandy bleached beaches, it was time stop for awhile and get some work done.

Spent several days in Cuenca, but the new client wasn't quite ready for the
project to begin. So, I hightailed it to Loja in a two-day 200km sprint over
several mountain passes.

A good friend from Quito insisted Loja wasn't particularly noteworthy, and if
I was going to sit in front of a computer for hours on end, I should do it in
a place with a view. So, 18 days ago I left Loja for the little village of
Vilcabamba (Sacred Valley).

She was right about the view.

The last two weeks I've been working hard; I put in over 50 hours this week. My
temporary residence has been the the gorgeous hostel of [Izhcayluma][izh].
It is probably the best marketed hostel in all of Ecuador. Nearly everyone I've
met in Ecuador has recommended it. In addition to the steady stream of travelers making their way south or north
who stopover for a few days (or more) in Izhcayluma, people seem to come from
all over the world just to visit.

While I've worked most of every day, invariably I took a break well past dark
to eat dinner and socialize with the current crop of guests. Three days seems
to be the time between turnovers, that is, the time after which I look up from
my computer, wipe the glaze off my eyes, and see all new faces.

I've met hundreds of people in my few weeks here, and, I would like to say, all
with interesting stories, but the truth is after the first week the stories all
start to sound the same. Though every couple days there is that one old man with great
tales of adventure from his youth or that young guy riding from Alaska to
Argentina on his motorcycle. I don't mean to devalue anyone's experiences, but
the unfortunate fact is <a
href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html"
title="The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride
a bike">it has all been done before</a>.

People are interesting, every one of us, but among travelers travel
stories can be a bit repetitive. When faced with the inevitable hostel dinner
conversation (*"How long have you
been traveling? Wow! Where are you going? That's cool. How much longer do you
have?"* etc.) I try to steer the conversation to something else: politics, pop
culture, technology, work, life, anything but travel.

That mini-rant out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I've met some awesome people and had great times. My ping pong game has seriously improved. As nice as Izhcayluma is (both in price and atmosphere)s, today I woke up with that itch. It's time to move on.

**Tomorrow I leave for Peru.**

Well, I head in the direction of Peru. I suspect it will take me two days to
reach the border.

I'm taking the remote border crossing of Zumba - La Balsa, a remote and seldom
used crossing in the east of Ecuador/Peru. Remote and seldom used, because the
road is one-lane unpaved, dirt and gravel for hundreds of kilometers through
steep and windy mountain passes.

*Why?!*, I ask myself,  am I taking the most difficult route into Peru? Well, there
are some legitimate reasons such as:

* Avoid the dirty, busy, and dangerous Pan Americana highway
* Avoid the central-northern part of Peru which is miles of tedious desert
* See some gorgeous vistas as I wind my way through the Andes

But, ultimately, these are merely happy bonuses. The truth is that taking
the road less traveled on my definitely-not-a-mountain bike and spending weeks alone braving rain and muddy roads is exactly the sort of discomfort that makes for a good adventure. Maybe I have some underlying masochistic tendencies, though I prefer to frame it in the old adage <abbr title="Oh, god, how cliche of me">"*No Pain, No Gain*"</abbr>.

It's going to be a bumpy ride.
