**From:** Progreso, Ecuador

Woke early. Slept soundly aside from a strange dream where my hidden camping
spot was invaded by dozens of gypsies traveling in covered wagons painted in
bright colors. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stepped into the dawn
I half wondered where the gypsies had gone.

Broke camp quickly, packed up my bike and headed back onto the steep rough
road. Not even 1km in I got my first flat. I've been using slime tubes, tubes
filled with a neon green slime that helps fills punctures. So, if I got a real
flat, then the puncture must be pretty large. Sure enough, I found a large
puncture, but it was quickly patched.

A few km after the patch I was running low on water, having indulged in 3 cups
of coffee this morning. I stopped shortly to fill my bottle up from a small clear waterfall. The mountain water was clear and tasted fresh. I filtered it quickly, though later in the day I filled up twice more and didn't filter. We'll see if I get sick.

After 5 or 6 more km I peaked the pass, where I could see far into the horizon.
The descent that followed turned out to be more grueling than the ascent. My
bike is not a mountain bike, the biggest consequence of this means I do not
have shocks. Racing down rough dirt and rocky roads with plenty of switchbacks
is not comfortable. Just 30 minutes in my hands were starting to develop
blisters from my vice like grip on the brakes. By the end of the day my hands
hand blistered, popped, and re-blistered several times. The pain was so intense
I could barely hold on the the handlebars.

Passed through the small villages of Valladolid and Palanda. Stopped in Palanda
for a quick lunch and resupply (more tuna). Didn't quite make it to Zumba,
despite the relatively easy and fast-going flat terrain in the afternoon.

Stopped in dusk at the tiny (less than 50 people) village of Progreso
20km before Zumba. There
were no restaurants, stores, or hostels, so I was going to ride out of town to
camp somewhere, but a kind local family fed me dinner and let me sleep in a spare bed. Apparently cyclists pass through that village often without stopping, and they were interested in my story.

Tomorrow Peru!
