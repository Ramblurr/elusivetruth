**From:** Vienna, Austria (May 10, 2013)

Spring has finally arrived. I set out to [paddle and pedal][bikeraft] my way
across Europe in the winter in the name of slow human-powered travel, but I've
gone so slow Spring herself as overtook me.  The winter was a challenge; I am
rueful to see it go. Oh, selective amnesia, you put that rosy nostalgic glow on
even the [miserable times](http://elusivetruth.net/2013/05/08/daily.html).

There are a few drawbacks to winter's departure:


1. **Bugs**

    Insects and spiders have arrived. The joy of camping is undermined by the
    creepy scrambling of spiders over the forest floor where you'd like to roll
    out your bed.

2. **Food Spoilage**

    This caught me unaware. Turns out I was using the winter outdoors as a
    limitless, carbon-neutral refrigerator. All foods would remain tasty for
    days in my food sack stored outside my tent or strapped onto my
    bike/raft.

    Come spring time and now I can no longer carry much meat (love them
    campfire steaks!). Also, sticks of butter now have a nasty habit of
    going soft and gooing everywhere.

3. **Bugs** - did I mention spiders?  *shudder*


### Florent, Chloe, Colin, and Felice

Outside Vienna I met an amazing French couple cycling from France to the Black
Sea *with their two young boys*, a journey of over four months. I encountered
them on the Danube bike path while biking around a lock. We said a few nice
words, Florent helped me with a bag that had come loose, then we parted ways.
Curiosity go the better of me however, so I turned back and asked if I could
follow them to the campground they were aiming for.

"*Why?*", I asked, "*How did you choose such a trip?*". Their response was
simple, "*we wanted to go on a family trip that was fun and cheap*".

We shared dinner near at the campground in Klosterneuburg, it was a lovely
evening that I'm lucky to have shared with this sincerely awesome family.
