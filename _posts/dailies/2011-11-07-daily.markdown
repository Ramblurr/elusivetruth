**From:** Cuenca, Ecuador

Sunday I left Salinas for Cuenca. By bus. I feel guilty for having skipped over
400km in just a few hours, when I'm supposed to by cycling across South
America, not "cycling most of the time, but when I get lazy I take a bus too."

Oh well, I'm not torn up about it. The fact is I want to get to Peru sooner,
and some tentative plans I had to do the Galapagos on the cheap fell through.
Turns out taking a cargo ship from Guayaquil to the Galapagos is as expensive
as flying. Bummed, I won't be able to see Janet, Wendy, or John over there.
Wish them the best of luck.

So Sunday was spent on a bus. Arrived in Cuenca around 5pm. While I had been
here before, I wasn't familiar with the neighborhood near the bus station. Once
again I implemented my strategy of pedaling off in a good looking direction.
Once again that strategy proved fruitful, in about 30 minutes I found downtown
Cuenca. (reminder to self: patent this brilliant method)

From there I remembered the way to one of my favorite hostels: <a
href="http://www.hosteltrail.com/posadadelriocuenca/" title="Posada del
Rio">Posada del Rio</a>. This place rocks. Fantastic kitchen, lots of
tableware, cooking utensils, and most importantly a giant stove with 6 burners.
In a busy hostel, with tons of people cooking, the kitchen can get crowded.
Superb wifi (also available in the rooms). A large spacious common area. Clean,
cozy-yet-not-too-cozy-if-you-know-what-i-mean dorms. Best of all is the crowd
it tends to attract: budget travelers who aren't afraid to come out of their
shells. Nearly every night there's a large group dinner as people pool
their food.

Today it rained. All day. Didn't go out, except to scrounge up some grub.
Took advantage of the fast Internet to do some much needed work. I'm getting
used to being that weirdo in the corner on the computer all day.

Had a mini Lord of the Rings marathon in the evening with a Frenchman and two
Canadian girls. Itching to get back on the bike.
