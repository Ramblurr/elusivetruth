**From:** Puerto Lopez, Ecuador

Visited Isla de la Plata yesterday. It is a little island covered in scrub
about 1 hour from Puerto Lopez by boat. Some call it the poor man's Galapagos
Islands, for it possible to a small handful of species there that also reside
on the Galapagos.

It was quite enjoyable, even though it was the dry season, so most of the
island's vegetation was dry and dead. Saw **A LOT** of blue footed boobies, many of
which had nested right on the trail.

On the way to the island a pod of dolphins followed us for a way, frolicking in
the surf kicked up by our skiff. In the bay we also caught site of a cute, lonely, sea turtle who was interested in the side of our boat.

Today, spent several hours working and reading, then spent the evening
hanging out in the village's main plaza with the <a

group. I admire their freedom. No ties to one place, no societal obligations.
Liberty requires living with the barest essentials, a purposeful absence of
possessions and relationships. It is a truly selfish state of being. Freedom isn't for everyone. Is it for me? Don't I want to *matter*?
