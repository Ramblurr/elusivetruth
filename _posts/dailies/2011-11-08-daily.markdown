**From:** Cuenca, Ecuador

Cuenca is a gorgeous city (even when it is raining).

Cuenca, however, is not a city for bicycles. If it isn't the lumpy
centuries-old cobblestone rattling the teeth right out of your skull, then it
is the villainous truck/bus drivers who have some sort of elaborate, callous
plan to rid their streets of cyclists.

More work today. Took the bike out for a short spin to do some errands (ATM,
coffee, spare nuts 'n bolts), hence the mini rant. Leaving tomorrow bright and early, that is the plan.
