My [Quechua language study project][source] was abruptly cut short in May when
a fantastic job opportunity presented itself. I abruptly packed up my little
life in Cusco and headed north to the USA for the summer.

While I've no regrets about leaving South America, I've left some loose ends
down there. First, I had a personal goal of crossing the continent on my bike,
but I only completed, perhaps, 25% before getting distracted by the Quechua
language and great friends in Cusco.

Second, during the course of my Quechua study I started [a project to document
stories][stories] with recordings and transcripts online. I've tons of recorded
material to process and upload.

I'm not done with South America or Quechua. I'm comfortable with lettings
experiences come and, but this isn't one of them. One of these days I'll finish my
cycling tour, and continue my study of the language.

Since my return stateside I've been visiting a bit of the USA. Kayaking in
Alaska, cycling in Colorado, and consulting work all over the country.

Having refilled the coffers, so to speak, I'll be headed back to Egypt in a few
weeks to brush up on my Arabic before beginning a Middle Eastern bike tour.
