**From: Huaraz, Peru**

It is 2012. Over a month has passed since my last entry, though don't mistake
the silence for inactivity. Quite a bit happened
the past month.

When I arrived at the border, my hands were a blistery mess secreting a vile
pus, thanks to the rough dirt roads and my lack of an adequate front
suspension. As much as I wanted to continue on by bike, the sharp gut-wrenching
pain radiating from my palms precluded any attempt to secure a strong grip on
the handlebars. Instead, I attached myself, my bike, and 4 bags to a group of
three swell Germans who arrived by bus. The next two weeks were spent in
their convivial company traveling around Northern Peru.

Too lazy to go into detail about the following period, though I'll do the math
for you: in those 4 weeks of December I cycled a mere 3 days. For all my
diligent stalkers out there here was my route.

 * La Balsa (border) to Chachapoyas (collectivo)
 * Chachapoyas to Leymebamba (bike, 1 day, 80km)
 * Leymebamba to Cajamarca (bus)
 * Cajamarca to Trujillo (bike, 2 days, 285km)
 * Trujillo to Lima (bus)
 * Lima to Trujillo (bus)

While I still scribbled a bit in my journal every couple days, every time
I attempted to muster up the motivation to write more I found
a convenient distraction. Often, the process of putting to paper coherent and connected
sentences from the turbulent nebula of my thoughts resembles an undesired chore.

 The two day, 285km bike ride from Cajamarca in the Andes to Trujillo on the
 coast was gorgeous. Starting at 8,900 ft
 (2,700m) you climb over 2,400ft (750m) before starting the long windy descent
 towards the coast. The <a

 In Trujillo I stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas, a place famous among everyone
 whose cycled in South America. Lucho, a retired racing cyclist, has been
 opening his house to traveling cyclists for over 25 years. He provides a bed,
 shower, and great company for as along as you want, **for free**. I took
 advantage of his hospitality for a week and spent the New Years with Lucho and
 his family.

 The morning after arriving in Trujillo I hopped on a bus for the 10 hour
 journey to Lima to visit a good 'ol friend from Ecuador who was heading back
 to the USA with her tail between her legs. Guess she couldn't handle the
 awesomeness that was Peru.

 Christmas in Lima. Bus back to Trujillo. Stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas. New
 Years in Trujillo. Hello 2012.
