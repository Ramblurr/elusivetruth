Today was my first official day on the *Ruta del Sol* (Route of the Sun), the
coastal route along Ecuador's coast.

Woke up early. Had some horrible instant coffee and a plate of eggs with cheese
at a little restaurant across the street. Stopped by an internet cafe to
consult Google about the best route out of town. Navigating cities is pretty
daunting, I prefer the open rural roads.

Stopped by a gas station on my way out to fill up my stove's fuel bottle with
gas. The attendants and patrons got a kick out of me waiting in line with the
cars for my turn to wheel up to the pump.

1 full fuel canister = 22 cents

Biked about 50 miles to the small coastal village of Puerto Cayo. When I pictured biking the 150 or so miles of the *Ruta del Sol*, I imagined
a leisurely ride under the gentle caress of the sun, along a smooth beach road, never to far from the surf. When I tired, I would simply pull over and enjoy the sweet fresh nectar from a downed coconut.

Turns out the *Ruta del Sol* at this season isn't particularly sunny, but when
the sun does show itself it is an intense and painful. Of course I forgot
sunscreen. Now I'm not just the strange guy on a bike, I'm the strange beet-colored gringo on a bike.

It also turns out the route itself is quite hilly, with many climbs and
descents. Nothing to steep, but more than I was expecting. Oh, and those
coconuts cost a $1 each, as the locals have already collected them for sale.

Illusion shattered. Oh well, I'm having a blast despite the hills and raging sunburn.
