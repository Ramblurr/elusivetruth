**From:** Guayaquil, Ecuador

Flight from Miami was uneventful. Successfully retrieved my bicycle from the
baggage claim and passed through customs with only cursory glance from the
officials. They seemed more interested in the little boxes of electronics Ecuadorians
were bringing home, than my large, table-sized box.

Finding a taxi proved challenging, as none of the little foreign four-doors
could fit the large bicycle box. After much frantic scrambling on their part--the *taxistas* didn't want to lose my business, even though I wasn't going anywhere without their help--they found a driver with a hatchback and I made it to the hostel before noon.

Postponed assembling my bike as work was calling. Worked all afternoon.
