Working on a new project to record and release online native Quechua stories,
myths, parables, jokes, proverbs, etc. I released the first one yesterday. It
is a short story about a condor and his girl. You can listen to it and read
along in Quechua: [Kundur (The Condor)][kundur]. English and Spanish
translations will be up soon.

People often decry the fact that Quechua is in decline, that tales and
traditions are being lost, as fewer and fewer children grow up speaking
Quechua.  By recording and making them available online, I feel that I'm doing
my small part to help preserve Quechua and its unique story.

Though, in some contradictory way, I feel that, by recording and transcribing
stories, I'm also contributing to the decline of Quechua.

*(For reference, the kinds of stories I'm referring to are tales, parables,
children's stories, myths, etc.)*

This strange thought occurred to me while editing a beautiful story, told from
memory by a young woman, who had many stories she couldn't wait to tell me.
I realized I couldn't think of any stories or myths from my culture. That
struck me as absurd. Surely, we have stories and myths? I mean,
I remember hearing them when I was a kid. Where did they all go?

Of course we have stories and myths (think Aesop's fables and Grimm's Fairy
Tales), but they're all stuck in books. We invented writing and books, so our
shared cultural stories can't ever be 'lost'...right?

Well, yes, technically, with books--and now digitization--most of our cherished
stories from childhood won't ever be lost. After all, that's the problem of the
Quechua people today: they didn't invent writing, and now they're culture is
endanger of vanishing out from under us. It's a mad dash to scribble down as
much history and culture as we can before the Westernization of their identity
is complete.

<!--- We can't possibly capture an entire history and culture ??  -->

Yet, even as their stories are disappearing, they are still very much alive.
They are living, breathing, animated creatures, that change slightly every time
they're told. They make their home in the heads of grandparents and their
grandchildren. What a fascinating life these stories have, not restricted by
their 'canonical' copies in some dusty tome, free to evolve and change.

Our stories are fixed in books, like beautiful vibrant butterflies pinned to
the pages of a child's insect collection. Their colors have faded and they've
become crispy in our hands. Our stories have 'right' versions. Don't dare
deviate from them or you'll be 'wrong'.

Maybe that's the price of preserving our stories. To save our stories we nail
them to the pages of books, where they become stationary and stagnant.

**Dead stories are better than no stories, I suppose.**

And with that in mind, I do my best capturing the stories of the Quechua,
pinning them to paper and hoping that in the process I'm not wringing too much life out of them.
