**From:** Budapest, Hungary (May 20, 2013)

Long lapses in days are common for me on this trip, and I would be hard pressed
to account for it. What can I say? I meet many kind and interesting people, eat
many tasty foreign treats, and, invariably, some portion of the stop I spend in
devotion to the gods of work, hunched in front of my computer. I do feel guilty
for the stops, not out of worry for the itinerary (hah!), but for neglecting
the road.

I find time upon the road, chasing down the horizon, is where I feel most
comfortable. The cities tempt me to remain, and I do enjoy these urban
interludes. I stay a day, a week, or longer, but eventually the spirit moves and
I move with it, enriched by the delay<a href="http://binaryelysium.com/prose/graham/the_gentle_art.html#21" title="Excerpts from, The Gentle Art of Tramping (1927)">*</a>.

Anyways, after a lackadaisical few weeks in Vienna drowning myself in tasty
coffee, one tiny cup of *melange* or *einspänner* at a time, the imminent
expiration of my Schengen Visa (the visa covering most of the European Union)
motivated me onwards. Over 500km through Slovakia and Hungary faced me before
the border of the EU, and fearing I wouldn't make it in my pokey boat, I biked
most of this leg.

Crossing borders in Europe today is surreal if you know even an inkling of
history. Within a few hours of leaving Vienna I crossed an imaginary line
into the Slav world, the "wild east". The utter lack of fanfare in which I
crossed from Austria into Slovakia is in stark contrast to the violent and
tumultuous history of the region.

Four hundred years previous I would have crossed the front line in the
Ottoman's great assault on the West. How different would things be now had the
Turks succeeded in capturing Vienna?

Fifty years ago I would have crossed the Iron Curtain and with it crossed the
ideological boundary over which the next half-century would be fought, not with
guns or bombs (well, not too many), but with words and fear.

Instead, I peddled past a clump of abandoned guard buildings, no police or
flags in sight.
