**From:** O単a, Ecuador

Heading from Cuenca to Loja today: 205km.

Departed from my hostel (Posado del Rio) in Cuenca around 7am after chatting it up with some other early risers over a cup of coffee. Navigation out of the city was easy enough using a map one of the lovely Hostel owners had given me.

About 10km or so out of Cuenca along level gray pavement lies the medium sized village of Cumbe. Stopped there to pick up some supplies in case I ended up wild camping in the mountains ahead. Tuna and mayonnaise, the perfect combination. Plenty of fat and protein to keep me going. Canned tuna keeps forever, as does this Ecuadorian mayo that doesn't require refrigeration (or so they tell me).

Stumbled across the *mercado* (open air market with cheap adhoc restaurants),
and ended up relaxing for a bit for some more coffee and friendly conversation
with the locals.

I noticed a man with a bicycle cart proffering a
beverage in old grimy wine bottles. Curious, I asked to try a bit, to which he
responded by handing me a full (12oz) cup. The mysterious piping hot beverage was the
color of maple syrup, with the same consistency, and tasted like, well, plants. It wasn't an unpleasant taste, mind you, but it wasn't sweet. Only then did it occur to me to ask what it was: *aguardiente* (lit. "fiery water", sugarcane liquor) in agave (the cactus) juice.

...and that was how I came to be pedaling out of Cumbe with a not-so-trifling buzz at
8am.

After Cumbe the road quickly turned uphill as I headed for my first, of several, 12,000 foot mountain passes. An hour or so into my ascent I stopped to rest on the
curb, and struck up a conversation with an ancient farmer, with skin like aged
brown leather and a sprightly step, tending to his mountain-side field. He
assured me with the utmost compassion that my ascent was almost over,
"*media hora en bicicleta, no mas*", no more than half an hour to go by bike. Tossing a grateful "*muchas gracias, adios se単or!*" over my shoulder I pushed off with a renewed vigor. This mountain was mine.

Two and a half hours later I reached what I suppose to be the summit, as instead
of constant uphill the terrain it morphed into rolling hills. I had a banana
to celebrate my victory and resolved not to ask locals about the length of ascents again. The mental deception is too taxing; just concentrate on the road you can see in front of you.

<p>Cheers! First mountain pass of the day conquered.</p>

Ever since I had left Cuenca I had been fleeing from ominous storm clouds; around
1pm they caught me. With the cold, harsh rain came a dense gray fog. The following several hours were some of the most thrilling riding I've done. Screaming down mountain passes, taking curves with 10 feet of visibility, all the while squinting in pain through the cold torrent, is a singular experience. Several hoots and hollers were belted out in my adrenaline filled furor.

Eventually the rain and fog passed as I descended about 3,300 ft into a village, only to find another 3,500 foot ascent waiting for me. This time around I was chasing the sun into dusk. Determined to summit before dark, I pushed on; a multicultural medley of Spanish, English, and Arabic curse words carried me to the peak.

<p>The exhilaration of summiting an 11,000-foot pass: something not sold in stores. Crazed look optional.</p>
</div>

Knees wrung, thighs cramping, and mental faculties slightly unhinged I drifted the last four or five miles in a giddy delirium to the small pueblo of O単a (200 people) where I staggered up one final dirt hill to the only hotel and into bed as the sun sunk behind the horizon.

Half way to Loja. 100km down, 105km more to go. Tomorrow is looking to be more of the same.
