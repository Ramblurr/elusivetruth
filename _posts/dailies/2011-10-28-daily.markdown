**From:** Manta, Ecuador

A weekend of work suddenly dissolved after a short conference call in the
morning. With that out of the way it was time to hit the road.

Packed up my panniers, attached them to the bike and made off for the bus station in the early afternoon. Ticket for the 4-hour journey from Guayaquil to Manta by bus was $4. Decided to bus it because I'm itching to get to the coast, and I've received quite a few warnings that biking out of Guayaquil isn't the best idea. My bike wasn't the strangest thing to go underneath the bus, one family had a live goat they tethered next to my bike.

The bus ride was fun. Sat next to a stunning Ecuadorian girl with long coffee colored hair and a cute chubby little boy who loved to pull at my whiskers. Arrived in Manta shortly before dusk. No reservation. No map. No guidebook.
Just my loaded bike and some grimy busy streets to explore. Took off in
a direction that looked promising. Passed by the beach, saw a hostel sign: $10 for
the night, private room+bathroom, "hot water", and cable TV. Good enough.

Weekend Ho!
