**From:** A tent on the road to Zumba, Ecuador

Today is the first leg of my journey to the Zumba/La Balsa border crossing with
Peru.

Left Vilcabamba late in the morning after a leisurely coffee (or two) and
a brief shopping expedition for food supplies. It is difficult to keep a high
caloric intake when biking 8-10 hours a day and the feeling of intense hunger
is very distracting, so taking the right snacks is important. Today in Vilcabmaba I was lucky to find all-natural
peanut butter (aka ground peanuts) and coconut oil, two high-protein and
high-calorie foods. I use bread as a hand-to-mouth food delivery device. For
dinner it will be tuna and mayonnaise.

The road out of Vilcabamba was a steady incline that went through some intense
road construction. Apparently, a Chinese company is opening a mine in the area,
and they need to widen the roads to make room for the large dump trucks. The
road was very muddy and I got bogged down in about 300m of mud. It took about
30 minutes to drag my load to the dry dirt on the other side.

About 5km out of Vilcabamba the construction and dirty roads cleared up, and
I enjoyed smooth pavement for 10km more or so. The landscape consisted of
rolling hills covered in green and dotted with shrubs and short trees.

At some point during the day I passed the little *pueblo* of Yangana. There
weren't any open restaurants, so I just drove through. A kind man stopped me
and told me there weren't any other villages for another 55km over two 
mountain passes. When I told him I wasn't worried, I had a tent and food, he gave me that (unfortunately) familiar look that says *you're-obviously-off-your-rocker-so-I'm-going-to-back-away-slowly-and-smile*. I thanked him for his advice and pedaled up the steep hill out of town.

Shortly after Yangana the pavement ended abruptly.

The beginning of the rough road corresponded with the beginning of the first
mountain pass. Several km in the pavement started
again as abruptly as it had ended, but only on one half of the two-lane road
(they're working on surfacing the road).
Thankfully it lasted until the summit, where the road turned into a steep
downhill packed-dirt surface. I don't expect to see smooth roads again until
Peru, some several hundred km ahead.

I hate carrying a watch. I deliberately don't carry one when riding; it's a little extra rebellion against civilization. The only times I need to know are "*Is it hungry time?*" and "*Is it sleeping time?*"

When I descended the first (small) pass and started up the next into Podocarpus
National Park, the sun was
racing towards the horizon. Looking at my personal watch, the lone hand was
pointing squarely between "sleeping-o-clock" and "hungry-o-clock", also known
as "keep-going-thirty." So, I kept going.

The road was single-laned, cliff-mountain road covered in loose dirt and large
loose rocks. In a few portions it was killer steep. Not the kind of terrain my
half-bald tires can get traction on. Pushed about 300m total here.

A little while later, my clock hand was cruising towards "sleeping-o-clock", so
I began looking for a camping spot. The thing about mountain cliff roads, is
that, on one side you have a cliff wall, and on the other side you have a cliff
drop-off. No shoulder. Camping in the road was briefly on the table, but the
committee voted against that proposition; although, it was a close vote.

The fog was rolling in (seriously Andes, what's with the fog at dusk? It's like
a bad horror movie) when I found a small enclave off the side of the road near
the cliff. Enough space to hide my bicycle and tent. Done.

Only 45km (approx) today, felt like more. No rain. No mechanical problems.
Sweet camping spot.
