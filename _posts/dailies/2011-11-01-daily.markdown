**From:** Puerto Lopez, Ecuador

Puerto Lopez is a small fishing village on the Pacific coast. Yesterday, just
after dawn, I went down to the beach as the fishermen were pulling in from their long
night of fishing. Saw some pretty cool catches: little hammerhead sharks, big
colorful tunas, and even a 7-foot long shark.

Ended up working the rest of the morning and afternoon, then rode my bike around town in the evening. They don't celebrate Halloween here.

Met some interesting travelers on the beach last night: Two girls, Canadian and
Chilean, traveling
separately and alone, who make artisanal crafts (necklaces, little bags,
bracelets, etc) from beads, hemp, bone, shells, etc. When I ran across them they were picking up shells from the beach to use in their creations. They wander from place to place, setting up little tables in the center of towns to sell their art. They live on less than $10 per day.

It's not a tough life, but it isn't easy either. Ignoring the fact I have no creative inclinations in that regard, if I couldn't work over the Internet, I could easily see myself ending up like them to support a nomadic lifestyle. Maybe I would be the wandering computer repair hobo.

Today I'm taking a little tour to *Isla de la Plata* (Island of Silver), also
known as the Poor man's Galapagos, to see a few species of animals found on the
Galapagos islands. Birds, sea turtles, and with luck some dolphins and perhaps 
a whale.
