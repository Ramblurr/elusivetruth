**From:** Mainz, Germany (February 29, 2013)

Today I say farewell to the river Rhine as I take a turn onto the river Main.
Over 500 kilometers I cycled along her banks, yet it was nought but a drop in
the voluminous mass of history and mystery that flows through her. Her journey
and my journey were intertwined shortly, yet the Rhine's journey is one
thousands of years in progress. She knew nothing of my presence. Nonetheless,
I am better off for it.

My stretch along the Main will be even shorter, a mere interlude before the great
affair that will be the Danube.

The past few hundred kilometers were spectacular. Castles suddenly looming out
of the mist and snow so often I became immune to their archaic charm. Today
alone I must have passed half a dozen.
