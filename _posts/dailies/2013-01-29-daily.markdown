**From:** Kleve, Germany (January 9, 2012)

We're a bit more than a week into 2013 and I'm a week into my <a href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html"
title="A Boy, his Bike, and his Boat">self-powered amphibious journey across
Europe</a>.

On January 1 <a
href="http://elusivetruth.net/2013/01/27/power-of-beginnings.html" title="Power
of Beginning">I began</a> at the North Sea coast in The Netherlands and peddled
east upstream along the waterways that make up the Rhine river delta.

Cycling in the Netherlands is unique experience. There are no hills and
dedicated cycling paths criss cross the entire country. It's almost boring.
Thankfully, I had some antics to keep me entertained.

Often I encountered water crossings that required boarding a free ferry to
a cross 100 meter stretch of water. It didn't really occur to me until I was
wheeling my load up the on ramp of the first ferry, I'm on a *human powered*
journey, crossing a bit of river on a ferry, no matter how short, is definitely
cheating. Plus, this is why I have a raft, right? Hell yes! I frantically
scrambled back down the on ramp like a madman with a profound ship-deck phobia.

Needless to say, every time I peddled up to a ferry crossing and proceeded to
conjure a massive raft out of seemingly nowhere, then miraculously fit all my
crap into it, *including my bike*, there were many a stunned onlooker gaping
incredulously as I paddled towards the opposite shore.

The weather has been great so far. Too great actually. Temperatures haven't
even dipped below freezing, and I've sun on my face more often than not.  My
photos can attest to this decidedly gorgeous weather.

Where is winter? **Bring on the misery.**
