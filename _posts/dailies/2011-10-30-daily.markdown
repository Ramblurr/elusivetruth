**From:** Puerto Lopez, Ecuador

Short ride today. After two days of riding past gorgeous beaches, I'm stopping
in Puerto Lopez for several days to enjoy the surf, and see some local sights.

Found a great hostel (Hostel Maxima) 1 block from the beach. The kind owners graciously
allowed me to setup my tent in the large grassy courtyward for only $2 per night with access to the shared
bathrooms, kitchen, and oh-so-important WiFi.
