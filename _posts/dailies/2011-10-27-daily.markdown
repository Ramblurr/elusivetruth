**From:** Guayaquil, Ecuador

Worked all day in the hostel lobby. Who knows what the staff and other patrons
(all Ecuadorian) thought of the weird, nerdy gringo camped in front of his
computer for 8+ hours.

Broke up the bike box in the early afternoon. Amazingly, there was no damage to the frame, despite my shoddy packing job. Assembly was straightforward, and after tweaking the front brake, everything appeared to be working. Took it for a spin in the golden dusk on the streets of Guayaquil. Ate Chinese again.
