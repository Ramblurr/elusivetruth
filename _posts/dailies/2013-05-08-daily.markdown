**From:** Straubing, Germany *(March 26, 2013)*

Rough day. A strong icy cross wind blew most of the day. Water dripping down
from my paddle froze. Froze everywhere.

Faced my first lock in this frigid weather. A mere 400m, no distance at all
when riding a bicycle, but a herculean feat when with a raft laden with nearly
80 pounds of gear. Boats on land are quite cumbersome things.

Luckily there was a push cart for kayaks available. My raft didn't fit
gracefully, but I managed.

While slowly trudging the 400m (200m uphill then 200m downhill), my thoughts
drifted to the early polar explorers. My slight inconvenience here in the
middle of Europe couldn't compare to their accounts of the fierce blizzards and
dark winters huddled in huts sucking seal blubber but slowly starving.

Either the cold numbed my brain or the daydreaming about advancing upon the
South Pole distracted me, regardless, I did something incredibly stupid.

I pulled my raft over a sharp rock and tore a hole in her bottom. Of course I didn't
realize this as I loaded the raft, nor when I paddled out into the river.

Oh sure, there was this nagging concern that floated to the surface of
awareness: *why the hell are my feet so cold?* I pushed the thought away, *"of
course my feet are cold. My hands are cold, my face is cold. I'm covered in
ice, everything is cold."*

It wasn't until the creeping chill reached my ankles that the realization
pierced my stupor like an icicle lobotomy.

**Holy shit, there's a fuckton of water in here!**

The subsequent moments were followed by such a fierce flurry of paddling, I
likely broke some packraft landspeed records. I did a harsh 180 degree turn and
made for the shore of the lock's embankment.

Sure enough, after unloading everything and flipping her over, there was a
quarter sized rip in the bottom. A substantial repair would be required.

Fighting feelings of defeat and inadequacy, I solemnly rolled up the raft,
assembled the bike and rolled on to find a hide-away where I could build a
fire, get warm, and regroup.

Later, curled up in my sleeping bag next to the glowing embers of a dieing fire
I pulled up Scott's Last Expedition on my Kindle and encountered this gem:
