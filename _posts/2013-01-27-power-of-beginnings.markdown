up a mountain or suffering through the daily grind, we're all the narrators of
our own internal story. There is power in being an active narrator."

What makes a journey? Journey is just a fancy term for a narrative over time
and space, probably following some sort of linear progression.

We're all the narrators of our own little stories, which we categorize
into thematic chunks: *"the highschool years"*, *"when I lived on the East Coast"*,
*"dating punk rock girls phase"*.

I've never taken such classes, but I would imagine on the first day of the
bi-weekly night class on writing taught at the local community college, the
instructor dramatically storms into the room, stalks up to the green chalk
board, and scratches out "NARRATIVE" in large block letters. He then
adds three bullet points underneath: (1) Beginning, (2) Middle, (3) End.  With
a deft spin, he faces the class and says something... but here my imagination
fails me.

Regardless, of what he says, or if my fancied night class instructor is able to
produce the above without squeaking the chalk, a narrative must have a
beginning. Now, whether narratives must have middles and ends is a question I'll
punt, I want to focus on beginnings.

*(It just occurred to me, having these thoughts at the turn of the New Year,
a time so profoundly associated with beginnings, is sickeningly coincidental.
Dates are arbitrary.)*

The beauty of being the narrator of your life, is while you might not have
control of the details, you do get to [frame the story][framing] and define
beginnings.

The power to begin is a wonderful tool. You know you've stumbled upon a goal or
desire worth having when it inspires and terrifies you at the same time.
Electricity sizzles up and down your spine while your gut quivers. You feel it,
literally, in your heart, it's that knot of uncertainty. The fear of beginning is
paralyzing.

Beginning is the hardest part of any adventure. Once you've flipped the mental
switch and overcome that inertia, everything else falls into place.

**The secret is to begin.**
