A [little over a year
ago](http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/23/coming-out-so-to-speak.html) I declared
my intent to extend my after-graduation trip indefinitely. At the time I didn't
give much in the way of explanation for the decision, preferring to focus on my
fortune of having a geo-independent means to earn an income.

The truth is, I didn't really understand my decision and what I wanted from such
a lifestyle. Oh, I certainly had a clear idea of things I did not want. I, not
so subtly, exclaimed my disgust at the traditional workplace environment:
cubicles, a commute, mind-numbing routine, etc.

I was rebellious.

*Career?* Phaw, a career is The Man's instrument of slavery. *Success?* Hah!
Success is the carrot society dangles in front of you while luring you into the
tar pit of debt.

Lurking under the surface was a growing suspicion that I was just acting the
capricious twenty-something, discontent and trying desperately to live in my
own idealistic reality.

That suspicion gnawed at my insides for months, until it forced itself out of
my subconscious and manifested as guilt. Guilt at taking what I had been
generously bestowed in life, by my parents and mentors, and selfishly tossing
it out in a youthful gesture of insubordination. After all, the least
I *should* do to repay their essential contribution to my life is be
successful (i.e., great stable career, on the path to 2.5 kids and the white
picket fence), right?

Well, here I am, over a year later, and I've worked through that guilt. It
wasn't easy, though in retrospect it was pretty silly. I'll spare you the
clich√© tortuous process of self-reflection, save a single thought:

Your life is yours and, by my estimation, it's the only one you've got. Don't
let others expectations for you keep you from choosing happiness. If you talk
to those whose opinions you value, you might even find out what *you think*
they expect of you is simply you projecting.

Redefining success for myself and eschewing associated preconceptions was my
most important accomplishment of the past year. How did that year go? I'm
a recently graduated Computer Science major making a [tad more than the poverty
line][poverty] when my average peer is [making over $90,000][others], but
measuring my self by that standard is ludicrous. Instead, I look at
what I've done that's important to me and gauge progress according to those
values.

Now, don't miss my point here. I would be the last to argue that a life of
homelessness, material minimalism, and radical autonomy is what everyone should
want in life, but those three principles are what make me happy (for now at
least). Yet, the notion of happiness and success we're raised believing is the
opposite of those principles[^1].

What *actually* makes you happy? That's what you should pursue and how you should measure
success.
