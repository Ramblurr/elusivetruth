teaser: Three days on the beach can make you pretty lazy. The uncomfortable bus ride back from the beach combined with some 90s eurodance pop apparently sparks revelations.

"But what if I want one of those ice-creams after I finish this?", said my friend gesturing to her $1.50 hamburger.

"Then you can walk back to the town and get one", responded my other friend matter-of-factly.

The first friend gazed with resentment at the 20m of soft sandy beach between her and the town, sighed, and lugubriously took a seat on the towel giving up on the ice-cream for the time being.

"You know," started the second friend, **"these aren't real problems."**

We laughed at the absurdity of getting in a huff over a short walk on a beautiful beach to an ice-cream vendor. Such is the lethargic lifestyle you slip into after a few days in a relaxing beach town.
 
Fast forward two days. Now we're in a frantic dash through the town searching for the bus we booked 24 hours prior, but it has already left without us. We dawdled too long.

A public bus rolls up and a crowd of people rush toward it. Being in a pretty remote location along the coast of Ecuador, we know this bus might be our only chance to make it out tonight. In true Ecuadorian fashion we push and shove our way inside and claim 2 seats for ourselves. Even though I'm still barefoot I take one for the team and stand in the grimy, muddy aisle. 

The bus pulls out into the night, and only then do we think to ask if it will drop us off anywhere near to where we need to be. We have 10pm tickets for our overnight bus from Libertad to Quito. It is 7:30pm, and with at least a 1.5hr ride from Montanita--though public buses are notorious for taking longer by taking frequent stops--we'll be cutting it close.  We don't even know where we need to go to catch our bus in Libertad.

A cockroach or two skitter across my feet, but I barely notice as I'm locked in struggle against gravity to keep my balance as the bus careens around black corners while crossing into the incoming lane. Meanwhile, worries are wheeling through my mind: *what's* going to happen *if* we miss our bus? *What if* we can't find the terminal? We all have work tomorrow morning, we're probably going to miss it.

Arriving in an unfamiliar city at night with no plans for accommodation, much less a simple notion of where you are in the city is never a great idea. Given that this is Ecuador, the streets at night are most likely dangerous. Great!

The driver puts in a 90s dance mix, and the soul-searching strain of Haddaway's "What is Love?" drifts above the raucous teenagers partying in the rear and the oppressive droning of the engine.

As I begin to quietly sing along--*What is love?*--I mentally take a step back and laugh at the absurdity of the situation--*Oh baby, don't hurt me*. Here I am, caught up in a huff about some minor transportation setbacks--*Don't hurt me no more*--while on my way back from a luxurious beach getaway where I spent more in a weekend than people in the villages we're driving past make in a two weeks.

The sage words of my friend suddenly coalesced in my mind:

<blockquote><strong>These aren't real problems.</strong></blockquote>

Throughout all my travels, I've yet to encounter a truly dire setback, and I think I've had my share of memorable obstacles: getting H1N1 in Egypt, ending up 8 hours off-course in remote eastern Turkey after a 12hr bus ride, taking sketchy private "taxis" at 1am from a Jordanian port.

In my [last post][comingout] I professed my desire to start framing my day-to-day life in the context of the moment, that is, I've resolved to put less emphasis on long term plans and issues. This is because I had let my perspective grow disproportionally large. There were so many goals and problems I was trying to court, that I simply felt overwhelmed. By contracting the scale of my outlook, I've been able to make my goals and problems manageable again. While I still believe this to be the right attitude for me to adopt, I am cognizant of the fact that I can't become utterly consumed with the present lest I lose valuable perspective in the other direction.

Your problems can appear much more grievous and exigent than they would be if you placed them against the proper backdrop. Taking a mental step back and surrendering a little chuckle about your circumstances can make all the difference. 

Back on the lurching bus, I bopped my head to Haddaway with a shit-eating grin on my face. We'd make it home, and if we didn't, well, that would be another adventure.
