teaser: A little end of year reflection on the narrative of my travels. As it turns
        out, the important details aren't where I am or why I'm there.

The last three months were... extensive. The little bundles of experience are
jostling in my skull still bright and vivid. But, memory fades, I know this too
well. Eventually, I'll be grasping at memories of memory. Better get them onto
paper. That means a story.

I'm always interested in the characterization of stories, that is to say, how we
frame them. Framing is necessary for any story.

While I can remember the last few months with relative clarity, and revisit
recently made memories, the sights, the sounds, the feelings, the friends, old
and new, I cannot transfer that experience to paper without losing that
visceral vibrancy that breathes life into memories.

So, I'm left with telling a story, which requires a proper perspective.
I could frame story in terms of **geography**: Egypt, Tunisia, Ireland,
Germany, Switzerland, and The Netherlands.

Or, I could frame the story around my **intentions**: language learning followed by
some money making, then cycling, more wheel grinding, and a little rebellion.

*Location* and *intention*.  These days nearly all my interactions with others
are staked between these two reference points, so they seem a natural enough frame for
my story.

After all, *you're always somewhere*, and *you're there for a reason*,
right?

Creepy. The compulsion to have tidy narrative is distracting, and
more severely, restraining.

<blockquote>Travel is a state of mind. It has nothing to do with existence or the exotic. It is almost entirely an inner experience.<br />&mdash; <a href="http://binaryelysium.com/prose/theroux/brief.html#2">Paul Theroux</a></blockquote>

When flipping through pages of memory, rarely is it where I was or my reason
for being there that makes me pause and cherish the memory.

Rather, it is the people, the kind, gracious folks who bless me with all manner
of good will. They invite me into their homes, share their food,
their company, their troubles.

Sometimes the encounters are short, chance passings on the side of the road.
A water bottle kindly offered through a window by an outstretched
arm when I've used up my water rations earlier than expected.

Other times, I stay for weeks or months, taking up residence in a spare room or on
a couch. Cooking meals, sharing laughter, developing true friendships.

The where and the why are irrelevant details in these stories, mere
backdrop, *for these stories are about people.*

There we go. I've found the framing for my story.
