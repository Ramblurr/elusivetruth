title: Escaping the City
uuid: 8b2530ae-a011-11e0-96c2-525400e84d96
teaser: For the past several seeks I've essentially been living in Quito, Ecuador. Last weekend I felt particularly stir-crazy, whether from the city itself or being in one place so long (almost four weeks) I'm not sure. I temporarily satisfied this restlessness by taking a weekend to hike and camp in the Ecuadorian Andes.

For the past several weeks I've essentially been living in Quito, Ecuador. Most people would probably disagree that I'm 'living' here, after all, I've only been here four weeks. While I don't claim to know Quito particularly well, it certainly feels like I'm living here. For me, 'living' someplace implies a routine or a certain regularity to your activities. 'Traveling' suggests just the opposite. Travelers rarely do the same thing more than once in the same location. For example, I walk the same way to Spanish lessons every day, frequent the same grocery store, and grab an espresso at the same cafe. Travelers might do some of those things, but it would be exceptional for one to make a repeat visit. Whereas, I have fallen into a predictable routine:

* Wake up around 6:30 am
* Coffee until 7am
* Work until 9am
* Spanish Lessons until 1pm
* Work until 6 or 7pm
* Drinks with a local or foreigner
* In bed by 11 pm

On the other hand, 'living' some place involves a sense of permanency that I don't associate with my stay here in Quito. When people ask why I am in Quito I answer "learning Spanish"; I'm not here to work and I'm not merely here to see the tourist attractions. Quito is an interesting city, and I really enjoy getting to know her and her people, but I won't stay forever. Being here on a tourist visa places a hard limit on the length of time I can be in Ecuador. Even if I choose to renew my visa for another three months, I won't spend the entire duration in Quito.

Another indication that I'm living in Quito, or at least begun to tire of my routine, is how agitated I felt last week with the desire to escape the city for several days. While the noise, traffic, and pollution in Quito aren't near as bad as Cairo (where I lived for a year), they do take a toll on your mental state.

On Thursday I decided I wanted to get out, so I began a semi-frantic search for somewhere to go. Via this great site called [Couch Surfing][CS] (a facebook-esque site for travelers---I'll write more about it at some point), I met an American named Lindsay. She had a tent and the same itch to escape our urban confinement. We made our plans on Friday: check out a region high in the Andes mountains called Quilotoa, hike around, and camp somewhere if possible.

We had no clue if camping was a possible, apparently camping isn't a popular activity in Ecuador. Optimistic that we would figure it out, we hopped on a bus early Saturday morning for Latacunga, a city several hours south of Quito. Once there we hopped onto another bus headed past Quilotoa, or so we thought. As is often the case when there is a language barrier, the shared understanding you have with someone is rarely as shared as you think . After a very, very bumpy two hours careening around corners and nearly going over the cliffs several times, we pulled into the small town of Zumbahua and were told to get off. Unfortunately, Lindsay had suffered a bad case of motion sickness during the journey (it was *not* pretty), so we thought we were being kicked off short of our destination for disturbing the passengers. 

In reality, the bus just didn't go all the way to Quilotoa, which we would have known had be bothered to read our guide books or do any sort of planning. We stood around scratching our heads, wondering "what now?", for a total of 30 seconds before a local pounced offering to give us a ride in his truck for the modest (*cough cough*) fee of $6. We should have bargained, but we didn't.

Jumping off the truck in Quilotoa we were greeted with the vista below. Quilotoa is located on the edge of a large crater lake. Eight hundred years ago the volcano here exploded violently, leaving this beautiful caldera lake. The locals say it is bottomless, but scientists put it at an astonishing 820 feet deep (almost as tall as the empire state building).

After eating some lunch and making sure Lindsay had recovered from the bus ride, we began the hike around the rim. Once again, had we done a little planning we would have known the rim was a much longer hike than it looked---a good five hours for fit hikers, which we were not. We started around two in the afternoon, confident we would make it back before dark. When six 'o clock rolled around, we were barely 60% of the way around and the sun was rapidly disappearing behind the horizon.  We had been looking for the opportunity to camp, and thanks to our carelessness, we had stumbled right into it. 

With darkness came the wind and cold. We made a fire, but it was hard won. The wind was fierce, the kindling wet, and good firewood scarce, though we had demonstrated our first ounce of forethought by collecting semi-dry branches while hiking once it became apparent we would not make it all the way around before dusk. Even with the wood, our prospects for a fire looked bleak and Lindsay began to doubt that I had ever been a Boy Scout. Using half a pack of travel tissues I was able to make the fire hot enough to ignite the branches. We enjoyed our canned tuna next to our sad little fire as you can see in the video below.

The next morning brought a cloudless sky and beautiful views of the countryside. We dismantled camp, spread and buried the remains of our fire (I'm happy to report we left no trace, aside from missing wood), and got back on the trail.

About an hour and a half into the remainder of the crater rim hike, we encountered a Fred and Thomas, a Swiss and German, hiking from Quilotoa to Chugchilán, a small village about a 4.5 hour hike away. They invited us to join them. Not having any concrete plans and unsure of what we would do once we made it back to the Quilotoa village, their invitation sounded like a good idea. 

This leg of the trek was even better than the crater rim trail. The trail took us down the side of a mountain, across the valley in the middle, and up the other side to the town. The views were stunning! Along the way we encountered many locals making the trek themselves with produce or livestock in tow. At times we felt pretty stupid for puffing and sweating from exertion, and lugging our big packs around, while the locals whizzed along in perfect shape.

We made it to to Chugchilán just as it started to rain. Exhausted and starving we sought out a meal in the town, but being Sunday most places were closed. A local hostel owner saw us as a ripe business opportunity, though I would like to think she just took pity on us, and opened her kitchen. After a simple but satisfying meal we thanked our host and politely refused the offer to stay at $16 per night. Instead we implored a local truck owner to drive us back to Zumbahua, where we could catch a proper bus to Latacunga and finally Quito. He wanted $40, which was $10 more than the usual rate, but we didn't have much of a choice, and he knew it. While the driver happily fastened a tarp on the top of the truck, Thomas observed that the ride back along bumpy, unpaved roads in a rigid wooden truck-bed would be very uncomfortable. He recommended (in true German spirit) that we should buy a crate of beer to ease our suffering. We heartily agreed.

From Zumbahua it was straightforward getting buses back to Quito. That night, in my hostel bed, falling asleep to the sounds of car alarms and awful karaoke didn't bother me as much as before. We'll see how long it lasts.
