<p>After reading this article (<a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN0522204620110606">Ecuador's Yasuni jungle protection plan</a>) by Reuters I couldn't help but get the impression that Ecuador is ransoming its rainforest.</p>

<p>Ok, that&#8217;s not quite what the article says, but reading between the lines I certainly get the impression that Ecuador is telling the world &#8220;<em>Hey World! Give us a bunch of money or we&#8217;ll destroy this <a href="http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=ECU+02&amp;mode=all">UNESCO protected</a>Â nature reserve.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not exactly an environmental activist (or oil advocate either), but this route seems pretty low. This stunt will allow Ecuador to blame everyone else but themselves if they have to start oil extraction in the rainforest.</p>

<p>Do you think Ecuador is morally in the clear?</p>
