<img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmdop49QiA1qkeurno1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Just returned to Quito from a 4 day Amazon Jungle Expedition, and I appear to have acquired some sort of Jungle Spots on my hands and all the way up my arms.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, they are just tiny little mosquito bites. I have been assured that aside from itching like heck (they are called fire mosquitos), the bites and spots are perfectly harmless. They are a small price to pay for the experience of camping in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest far removed from civilization.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll post more pictures and a story or two about the trip soon.</p>
