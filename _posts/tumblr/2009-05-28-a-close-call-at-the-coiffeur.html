title: A Close Call at the Coiffeur

<p><em>&#8220;Zamalek or Ahly?&#8221;</em>Â asked the barber as he grazed the straight-edge razor across my Adam&#8217;s Apple. Maybe he anticipated my flinch or maybe I&#8217;m just lucky to have escaped an accidental throat slitting. Either way I didn&#8217;t muse over my fortuitousness for more than a second, because the barber was eyeing me through the mirror expectantly, with his blade still at my throat. My Adam&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s wellbeing was on the razor&#8217;s edge.<br/><br/>Some background facts:</p>

<ol><li>Ahly and Zamalek are the two most famous soccer clubs in Egypt.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re in Egypt, then you&#8217;re either for Ahly or Zamalek.</li>

<li>Egyptians are intensely fanatical about their soccer.</li>

</ol><p><br/>A quick scan of the room viewable in the mirror didn&#8217;t reveal any clues to which team he supported, so I had a 50-50 chance. Even if I had the Arabic vocabulary to express my general apathy for soccer (not to be misconstrued as dislike) I suspect he would have assumed I was for his rival.<br/><br/>I guessed Zamalek. Goal! The razor began moving again, phew! After touting my love for Club Zamalek and bashing Ahly (those losers!) the conversation topic changed to English Action Films, and I enjoyed the remainder of my shave.</p>
