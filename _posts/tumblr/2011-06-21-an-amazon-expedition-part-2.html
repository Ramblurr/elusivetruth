<p>When <a title="An Amazon Expedition (part 1)" href="http://elusivetruth.net/post/6339375909/an-amazon-expedition-part-1">I last left the story</a> of my Amazon trip, my new friends and I had boarded a canoe <!--END-->and   headed into the Amazon Rainforest. The area we were headed into is called the Cuyabeno, a   portion of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. The Cuyabeno is a series of interconnected   lakes, lagoons, rivers, and floating forests that eventually drains into the Amazon River.   It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the world.</p>

<p>Enough with the book facts. <em>What did we do there? </em>I had trouble writing this update, as there was simply so much involved in this trip. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to give the reader a peek into the experience we had in the rainforest. Rather than gloss it over with a jazzy narrative or a play-by-play of each day, I am going to include a few photos of memorable moments. </p>

<p>We went on jungle hikes, where our guide used natural ingredients to create a stomach   soothing concoction for Oli (the one with the hat).

<p>We went fishing for and caught red-bellied piraña.

<p>We saw giant spiders, snakes, cockroaches, and other giant bugs straight out of a horror   film.

<p>We went swimming in the gorgeous lagoons.

<p>After swimming, we silently watched the brilliant sun set over the forest teeming with the   sound of life.

<p>We ate, slept and showered in thatched wooden huts on stilts.

</p>

<p>We laughed and played cards by candle light. We shared a miserable rainy jungle trek, and   bonded over hours of grueling paddling. </p>

<p>My words can&#8217;t begin to describe all that went into the experience. The photos can do a slightly better job, but so much of the experience was un-capturable by camera. In the end, the total experience is a only a shared memory of those seven people you see above, which is a special, yet at the same time a somber fact. We came together for a short time, strangers from all over the world, shared intense and unforgettable moments, and then scattered back into the wind.</p>
