<p>When <a title="An Amazon Expedition (part 1)" href="http://elusivetruth.net/post/6339375909/an-amazon-expedition-part-1">I last left the story</a> of my Amazon trip, my new friends and I had boarded a canoe <!--END-->and   headed into the Amazon Rainforest. The area we were headed into is called the Cuyabeno, a   portion of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. The Cuyabeno is a series of interconnected   lakes, lagoons, rivers, and floating forests that eventually drains into the Amazon River.   It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the world.</p>

<p>Enough with the book facts. <em>What did we do there? </em>I had trouble writing this update, as there was simply so much involved in this trip. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to give the reader a peek into the experience we had in the rainforest. Rather than gloss it over with a jazzy narrative or a play-by-play of each day, I am going to include a few photos of memorable moments. </p>

<p>We went on jungle hikes, where our guide used natural ingredients to create a stomach   soothing concoction for Oli (the one with the hat).<a title="Amazon Jungle by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5818995329/"><img alt="Amazon Jungle" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/5818995329_37533f65f6.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We went fishing for and caught red-bellied piraña.<a title="Catching Pirana by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5818998789/"><img alt="Catching Pirana" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/5818998789_c3a6ee2003.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We saw giant spiders, snakes, cockroaches, and other giant bugs straight out of a horror   film. <a title="Amazon Jungle by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5818999825/"><img alt="Amazon Jungle" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5818999825_747c1d3ed2.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We went swimming in the gorgeous lagoons. <a title="Amazon Jungle by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5855065989/"><img alt="Amazon Jungle" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5193/5855065989_acda6d1213.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>After swimming, we silently watched the brilliant sun set over the forest teeming with the   sound of life. <a title="An Amazon Sunset by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5818999145/"><img alt="An Amazon Sunset" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2785/5818999145_da52bc2e03.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We ate, slept and showered in thatched wooden huts on stilts. <a title="Amazon Jungle by   Ramblurr, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5819001089/"><img alt="Amazon Jungle" height="500" width="375" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2358/5819001089_92c4aaa0f4.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We laughed and played cards by candle light. We shared a miserable rainy jungle trek, and   bonded over hours of grueling paddling. <iframe width="500" height="375" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://www.elsewhere.org/mbedr/?p=5855065999&amp;v">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5855065999/&#8221; _mce_href=&#8221;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/5855065999/&#8221;   title=&#8221;Amazon Jungle by Ramblurr, on Flickr&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img   src=&#8221;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3245/5855065999_06485a748e.jpg&#8221; _mce_src=&#8221;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3245/5855065999_06485a748e.jpg&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221;   height=&#8221;375&#8221; alt=&#8221;Amazon Jungle&#8221;/&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe></p>

<p>My words can&#8217;t begin to describe all that went into the experience. The photos can do a slightly better job, but so much of the experience was un-capturable by camera. In the end, the total experience is a only a shared memory of those seven people you see above, which is a special, yet at the same time a somber fact. We came together for a short time, strangers from all over the world, shared intense and unforgettable moments, and then scattered back into the wind.</p>
