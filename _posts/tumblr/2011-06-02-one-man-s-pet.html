<p>One of my favorite aspects of traveling is the eating exotic food. This one might strike a little close to home.</p>

<p>This is a baked Guinea Pig, known is Spanish as <em>Cuy</em> (Koo-ee), prepared in the traditional Ecuadorian fashion.</p>

<p>The texture is quite like that of roasted chicken, but the flavor is decidedly porkish. The skin is very thick and (in my opinion) quite gross, not at all like the nice crispy skin of a chicken or juicy fat chunks from a beef steak.</p>
