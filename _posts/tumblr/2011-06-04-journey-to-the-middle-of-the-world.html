<p>I took a day trip from Quito to the equator (from which Ecuador takes its name) with a very friendly British couple (Lewis and Sara).Â </p>

<p>Apparently the equator makes it possible (or easier) to balance an egg, because of the opposing forces. In fact, the guide claimed all sorts of things are different at the equator: our weight, our strength, the direction water spirals, etc. I&#8217;m quite skeptical of all these claims, though I did manage to balance an egg on a nail.</p>
