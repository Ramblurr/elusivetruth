   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Novi Sad, Serbia (Aug 23, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals can be a bad thing. There I said it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I make a goal I feel, sometimes I feel restricted by it. As if the act of
committing to a goal involves being shrink-wrapped in cellophane and smothered
until the goal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering from some sort of undiagnosed attention disorder, invariably,
another alluring prize comes along knocking me off course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; My aborted cycle-across South America trip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal was to cycle across South America, but I only got some 1000km into the journey
before falling in love with &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily.html&quot; title=&quot;Going Domestic In Cuzco&quot;&gt;the Andes and the Quechua language&lt;/a&gt;. I ended up
spending over a year in the Andes never stepping foot further south than Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s happening again!&lt;/strong&gt; That is to say, this blather is a long winded
confession to a new goal.  I am deviating temporarily from my trans-Europe
waterway route along the Danube for a month or so to take a roundabout in the
Balkans, specifically former Yugoslavia and Albania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This region is too interesting, too unique, and &lt;em&gt;too close&lt;/em&gt; to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m stowing the boat and riding southwest from Novi Sad towards Sarajevo in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this means I’ll be paddling the rest of the Danube in the winter, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Tzcxe8MR1l0&quot; title=&quot;Video Update: Ice, Ice Everywhere!&quot;&gt;I’m no stranger to winter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My planned route through the Balkans is in &lt;mark style=&quot;color: #DF3AFC;background:none;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;purple&lt;/mark&gt; on the map.  Reality often
doesn’t go as planned. But the beauty in life comes from the unexpected and
unimagined. I’m OK with that, even if that means putting other goals on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any suggestions for my Balkan Detour? Places to visit, people to meet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Budapest, Hungary (May 20, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long lapses in days are common for me on this journey, and I would be hard pressed
to account for it. What can I say? I meet many kind and interesting people, eat
many tasty foreign treats, and, invariably, some portion of the stop I spend in
devotion to the gods of work, hunched in front of my computer. I do feel guilty
for the stops, not out of worry for the itinerary (hah!), but for neglecting
the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find time upon the road, chasing down the horizon, is where I feel most
comfortable. The cities tempt me to remain, and I do enjoy these urban
interludes. I stay a day, a week, or longer, but eventually the spirit moves and
I move with it, enriched by the delay&lt;a href=&quot;http://binaryelysium.com/prose/graham/the_gentle_art.html#21&quot; title=&quot;Excerpts from, The Gentle Art of Tramping (1927)&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, after a lackadaisical few weeks in Vienna drowning myself in tasty
coffee, one tiny cup of &lt;em&gt;melange&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;einspänner&lt;/em&gt; at a time, the imminent
expiration of my Schengen Visa (the visa covering most of the European Union)
motivated me onwards. Over 500km through Slovakia and Hungary faced me before
the border of the EU, and fearing I wouldn’t make it in my pokey boat, I biked
most of this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing borders in Europe today is surreal if you know even an inkling of
history. Within a few hours of leaving Vienna I crossed an imaginary line
into the Slav world, the “wild east”. The utter lack of fanfare in which I
crossed from Austria into Slovakia is in stark contrast to the violent and
tumultuous history of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hundred years previous I would have crossed the front line in the
Ottoman’s great assault on the West. How different would things be now had the
Turks succeeded in capturing Vienna?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago I would have crossed the Iron Curtain and with it crossed the
ideological boundary over which the next half-century would be fought, not with
guns or bombs (well, not too many), but with words and fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I peddled past a clump of abandoned guard buildings, no police or
flags in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spring in Austria</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Vienna, Austria (May 10, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring has finally arrived. I set out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html&quot;&gt;paddle and pedal&lt;/a&gt; my way
across Europe in the winter in the name of slow human-powered travel, but I’ve
gone so slow Spring herself as overtook me.  The winter was a challenge; I am
rueful to see it go. Oh, selective amnesia, you put that rosy nostalgic glow on
even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2013/05/08/daily.html&quot;&gt;miserable times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/3-Austria/29315100_Zwv6Mm#!i=2500539001&amp;amp;k=GvQKjwZ&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Drying things in the wind along the shores of the Danube&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/3-Austria/i-GvQKjwZ/0/L/DSC00325_v2-L.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Drying things in the wind along the shores of the Danube&quot; alt=&quot;Drying things in the wind along the shores of the Danube&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drying my belongings in the wonderful spring breeze&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few drawbacks to winter’s departure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Insects and spiders have arrived. The joy of camping is undermined by the
 creepy scrambling of spiders over the forest floor where you’d like to roll
 out your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food Spoilage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This caught me unaware. Turns out I was using the winter outdoors as a
 limitless, carbon-neutral refrigerator. All foods would remain tasty for
 days in my food sack stored outside my tent or strapped onto my
 bike/raft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Come spring time and now I can no longer carry much meat (love them
 campfire steaks!). Also, sticks of butter now have a nasty habit of
 going soft and gooing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; - did I mention spiders?  &lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;florent-chloe-colin-and-felice&quot;&gt;Florent, Chloe, Colin, and Felice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside Vienna I met an amazing French couple cycling from France to the Black
Sea &lt;em&gt;with their two young boys&lt;/em&gt;, a journey of over four months. I encountered
them on the Danube bike path while biking around a lock. We said a few nice
words, Florent helped me with a bag that had come loose, then we parted ways.
Curiosity go the better of me however, so I turned back and asked if I could
follow them to the campground they were aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;”, I asked, “&lt;em&gt;How did you choose such a trip?&lt;/em&gt;”. Their response was
simple, “&lt;em&gt;we wanted to go on a family trip that was fun and cheap&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared dinner near at the campground in Klosterneuburg, it was a lovely
evening that I’m lucky to have shared with this sincerely awesome family.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Temporary Defeat</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2013/05/08/daily.html" />

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2013/05/08/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Straubing, Germany &lt;em&gt;(March 26, 2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2013/03/ice-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rough day. A strong icy cross wind blew most of the day. Water dripping down
from my paddle froze. Froze everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced my first lock in this frigid weather. A mere 400m, no distance at all
when riding a bicycle, but a herculean feat when with a raft laden with nearly
80 pounds of gear. Boats on land are quite cumbersome things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily there was a push cart for kayaks available. My raft didn’t fit
gracefully, but I managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/2-Germany-The-Rhine/28521082_z9M77C#!i=2500506460&amp;amp;k=rHKcpQb&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Portaging over a lock using the handy kayak cart.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/2-Germany-The-Rhine/i-rHKcpQb/0/L/DSC00316_v1-L.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Portaging over a lock using the handy kayak cart.&quot; alt=&quot;Portaging over a lock using the handy kayak cart.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portaging over a lock using the handy kayak cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While slowly trudging the 400m (200m uphill then 200m downhill), my thoughts
drifted to the early polar explorers. My slight inconvenience here in the
middle of Europe couldn’t compare to their accounts of the fierce blizzards and
dark winters huddled in huts sucking seal blubber but slowly starving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either the cold numbed my brain or the daydreaming about advancing upon the
South Pole distracted me, regardless, I did something incredibly stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled my raft over a sharp rock and tore a hole in her bottom. Of course I didn’t
realize this as I loaded the raft, nor as I paddled out into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh sure, there was this nagging concern that floated to the surface of
awareness: &lt;em&gt;why the hell are my feet so cold?&lt;/em&gt; I pushed the thought away, &lt;em&gt;“of
course my feet are cold. My hands are cold, my face is cold. I’m covered in
ice, everything is cold.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until the creeping chill reached my ankles that the realization
pierced my stupor like an icicle lobotomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy shit, there’s a fuckton of water in here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subsequent moments were followed by such a fierce flurry of paddling, I
likely broke some packraft landspeed records. I did a harsh 180 degree turn and
made for the portage embankment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, after unloading everything and flipping her over, there was a
quarter sized rip in the bottom. A substantial repair would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2013/03/hole-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting feelings of defeat and inadequacy, I solemnly rolled up the raft,
assembled the bike and rolled on to find a hide-away where I could build a
fire, get warm, and regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, curled up in my sleeping bag next to the glowing embers of a dying fire
I pulled up Scott’s Last Expedition on my Kindle where I encountered this gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every day some new fact comes to light - some new obstacle which threatens
the gravest obstruction. I suppose this is the reason which makes the game so
well worth playing.”&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt;: Main-Danube Canal, Germany (23 March, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a camping spot last night was tough. Rode past beautiful forests and
fields all day, but when dusk came the land was either all tilled earth
&lt;em&gt;(sure sign spring is coming if the farmers are out ripping up my tenting sites)&lt;/em&gt;,
thickets of prickly brambles, or soft comfy grass but all
angled at a gut-wrenching 45 degrees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over an hour I rolled on through the dark, jerking over every moon-shadowed
pothole in the uneven dirt path until it dead ended in a cul-de-sac surrounded
by water.  I had taken a wrong turn into a tiny peninsula jutting into the
canal.  But what a dead end it was, anything but dead to my tired eyes, the
first flat stretch of even earth I’d seen for miles. The moonlight bathed it in
an enchanting glow and I half expected fairies to jump out and proclaim me
their king, or lull me into a sleep from which I’d awake their captive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laid out my ground cloth and sleeping bag dispensing with the tent entirely.
Consumed with that singular sensation of bliss earned through great exhaustion
I unfolded tired limbs onto my pad and stared bleary eyed into the infinite
depths of the Milky Way. Whatever thoughts were trickling through my head are
long gone, whisked into the heavens by a wintry zephyr and the deep soulful
rumblings of the river barges as they trundled past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/2-Germany-The-Rhine/28521082_z9M77C#!i=2423341417&amp;amp;k=M8CCCkz&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Bikerafting-Europe-2013/2-Germany-The-Rhine/i-M8CCCkz/0/L/DSC00282_v1-L.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gentle patch of earth might not look like much, but it was home for a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I made it to Regensberg! Significant, because it means I’ve joined
the Danube. I’ll paddle this river until it empties into the Black Sea, some
1500 miles and 8 countries from here. I embark on my raft Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Mainz, Germany (February 29, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I say farewell to the river Rhine as I take a turn onto the river Main.
Over 500 kilometers I cycled along her banks, yet it was nought but a drop in
the voluminous mass of history and mystery that flows through her. Her journey
and my journey were intertwined shortly, yet the Rhine’s journey is one
thousands of years in progress. She knew nothing of my presence. Nonetheless,
I am better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stretch along the Main will be even shorter, a mere interlude before the great
affair that will be the Danube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few hundred kilometers were spectacular. Castles suddenly looming out
of the mist and snow so often I became immune to their archaic charm. Today
alone I must have passed half a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Kleve, Germany (January 9, 2012)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a bit more than a week into 2013 and I’m a week into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/31/a-boy-bike-and-boat.html&quot; title=&quot;A Boy, his Bike, and his Boat&quot;&gt;self-powered amphibious journey across
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2013/01/27/power-of-beginnings.html&quot; title=&quot;Power of Beginning&quot;&gt;I began&lt;/a&gt;. The romantic in me insisted I begin as close as
possible to that point where the River Rhine delta disappears into the North Sea,
otherwise the Sea-to-Sea narrative would be a sham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking down the end of a river isn’t a straightforward task, you see, for
the great pulsing artery of life, trade, and history that is the river Rhine
was torn open some 200 km away by the scalpel of some prehistoric geographic
surgeon millennia ago. Much like a human artery, there’s rarely a clean
incision. Yes, a river’s end is a messy affair. It squirts and gushes in
branching streams that run through the landscape until it is swallowed by the Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tracing lines on a map and I found a beach on Holland’s North Sea coast, where,
best I could figure, some majority of the silted water molecules flowing out
into the grey expanse fancied themselves the River Rhine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strolling across the beach on that brisk winter morning full of beginnings
I sought the moment. It’s a ritual I’ve learned from other wandering dreamers,
other mad ones, madder than I. In our pursuit of the euphoric we squeeze the
moment tight like a wet piece of laundry. We suck up every last bit of
serenity, inhale it, steep ourselves in the ecstasy of the extemporaneous. Its
the traveler’s high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for a moment I stood there, feeling the gentle give of the sand underfoot,
and the heavy weight of my bike packed with the trappings of my life. The salty
chill stung my flushing face as the wind rushed past. The river’s confluence
with the sea murmured steadily while the gulls road that chilly wind up into
the sky. Their intermittent caws, praises to the great open, lifted my spirit
and I saw the road, that glorious symbol of freedom and life, stretching ahead
into the enticing unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the moment passed, wrung of all its beauty. Those fragments of experience
lingered but the wholeness of it was gone. It was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snapped a selfie, turned my back to the Sea and with the river on my right
I peddled upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/TheNetherlands/Rotterdam-2012/27335003_PST6gn#!i=2338023214&amp;amp;k=SN6vxwt&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;At the North Sea, a beginning.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/TheNetherlands/Rotterdam-2012/i-SN6vxwt/0/L/IMG_20130102_094442_v3-L.jpg&quot; title=&quot;At the North Sea, a beginning.&quot; alt=&quot;At the North Sea, a beginning.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling in the Netherlands is unique experience. There are no hills, unless you
count the little ramps up the dikes, and dedicated cycling paths criss cross
the entire country.  It’s almost boring frankly.  I did have some antics to
keep me entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several times I encountered water crossings that required boarding a free ferry to
a cross 100 meter stretch of water. It didn’t really occur to me until I was
wheeling my load up the on ramp of the first ferry, I’m on a &lt;em&gt;human powered&lt;/em&gt;
journey, crossing a bit of river on a ferry, no matter how short, is definitely
cheating. Plus, this is why I have a raft, right? Hell yes! I frantically
scrambled back down the on ramp like a madman with a profound ship-deck phobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I peddled up to a ferry crossing and proceeded to
conjure a massive raft out of seemingly nowhere, then miraculously fit all my
crap into it, &lt;em&gt;including my bike&lt;/em&gt;, there were many a stunned onlooker gaping
incredulously as I paddled towards the opposite shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather has been great so far. Too great actually. Temperatures haven’t
even dipped below freezing, and I’ve sun on my face more often than not.  My
photos can attest to this decidedly gorgeous weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is winter? The things worth doing are miserable. &lt;em&gt;Bring on the misery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At The North Sea, a beginning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a journey? Journey is just a fancy term for a narrative over time
and space, probably following some sort of linear progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all the narrators of our own little stories, which we categorize
into thematic chunks: &lt;em&gt;“the highschool years”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“when I lived on the East Coast”&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;“dating punk rock girls phase”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never taken such classes, but I would imagine on the first day of the
bi-weekly night class on writing taught at the local community college, the
instructor dramatically storms into the room, stalks up to the green chalk
board, and scratches out “NARRATIVE” in large block letters. He then
adds three bullet points underneath: (1) Beginning, (2) Middle, (3) End.  With
a deft spin, he faces the class and says something… but here my imagination
fails me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, of what he says, or if my fancied night class instructor is able to
produce the above without squeaking the chalk, a narrative must have a
beginning. Now, whether narratives must have middles and ends is a question I’ll
punt, I want to focus on beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It just occurred to me, having these thoughts at the turn of the New Year,
a time so profoundly associated with beginnings, is sickeningly coincidental.
Dates are arbitrary.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of being the narrator of your life, is while you might not have
control of the details, you do get to &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/30/framing-the-story.html&quot;&gt;frame the story&lt;/a&gt; and define
beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power to begin is a wonderful tool. You know you’ve stumbled upon a goal or
desire worth having when it inspires and terrifies you at the same time.
Electricity sizzles up and down your spine while your gut quivers. You feel it,
literally, in your heart, it’s that knot of uncertainty. The fear of beginning is
paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning is the hardest part of any adventure. Once you’ve flipped the mental
switch and overcome that inertia, everything else falls into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret is to begin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He is blooded to the open and the sky,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;He is taken in a snare that shall not fail&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been one for New Years resolutions. Maybe this is because I could
never get past the arbitrary demarcation of a “new year”, or perhaps
I subconsciously believe I don’t need improvement (more likely, I’m privately afraid to
fail).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping with such anti-resolution tradition, the goal I’m about to describe is
decidedly not a New Years resolution. Nevertheless, it is nearly 2013 and
I have a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-am-going-to-travel-from-the-atlantic-ocean-to-the-black-sea-using-only-human-powered-amphibious-travel&quot;&gt;I am going to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea using only human powered amphibious travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I am going to follow the inland waterways along the rivers Rhine,
Main, and Danube across Europe, and because I apparently harbor some (not-so)
latent masochistic tendencies I’ll be doing this &lt;strong&gt;during winter&lt;/strong&gt;, that is,
starting tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be journeying by bicycle and packraft. A packraft is an inflatable
dinghy-style craft that is quite light and paddled like a kayak. I packrafted
for the first time on Christmas Day this year after buying my floating blue transport
(pictured below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something about human-powered travel I find indelibly attractive.
Applying a bit of sweat and wit to traverse long distances is my
little rebellion against this machine dominated world of automation and
instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, self-supported &lt;em&gt;amphibious&lt;/em&gt; human-powered transport, hah! What a notion!
Water and land. Suddenly those blue squiggles on a map aren’t an annoying
obstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2012/12/bikeraft.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bicycle and gear strapped to my packraft. They call this bikerafting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-plan--difficulties&quot;&gt;The Plan &amp;amp; Difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is quite simple: &lt;em&gt;follow the skinny water east until I arrive at the big
water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not one for elaborate preparation, in fact, all I’ve really done to prepare
for this journey is buy the packraft and relevant water gear (paddle, drysuit,
etc), and some extra cold weather clothes. Traveling with a full camping
kit has become standard practice for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first European winter, so we’ll see how I fair. I will certainly
encounter snow in Germany, and I can’t imagine the paths along the River are
high priority for the snow plows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia informed me that the Rhine flows from Switzerland towards the
Atlantic, which means I’ll be peddling along shore upstream until I hit the
Danube. From the Danube I’ll blow up the raft and paddle onwards. I’ll buy river
maps in each country as I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html&quot; title=&quot;The Adventure Illusion&quot;&gt;Excessive planning destroys the adventure.&lt;/a&gt;
Having a contingency plan for every possible hurdle is antithetical to my idea
of adventure. Now, this is Europe after all, a highly populated area. I expect my most
arduous challenges will be finding rural camping spots (I hope to eat these words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an interactive map of the route I&#39;ll be following along the rivers:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Framing the Story</title>

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2012/12/30/framing-the-story</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ireland/An-Irish-November-2012/27318104_Fm8bTt#!i=2296132769&amp;amp;k=LMZKh3D&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Lonely Hound&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ireland/An-Irish-November-2012/i-LMZKh3D/0/L/IMG_20121110_153511_v1-L.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Lonely Hound&quot; alt=&quot;Lonely Hound&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Irish fox hound doesn&#39;t care about any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three months were… extensive. The little bundles of experience are
jostling in my skull still bright and vivid. But, memory fades, I know this too
well. Eventually, I’ll be grasping at memories of memory. Better get them onto
paper. That means a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always interested in the characterization of stories, that is to say, how we
frame them. Framing is necessary for any story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I can remember the last few months with relative clarity, and revisit
recently made memories, the sights, the sounds, the feelings, the friends, old
and new, I cannot transfer that experience to paper without losing that
visceral vibrancy that breathes life into memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m left with telling a story, which requires a proper perspective.
I could frame story in terms of &lt;strong&gt;geography&lt;/strong&gt;: Egypt, Tunisia, Ireland,
Germany, Switzerland, and The Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, I could frame the story around my &lt;strong&gt;intentions&lt;/strong&gt;: language learning followed by
some money making, then cycling, more wheel grinding, and a little rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Location&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;intention&lt;/em&gt;.  These days nearly all my interactions with others
are staked between these two reference points, so they seem a natural enough frame for
my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, &lt;em&gt;you’re always somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;you’re there for a reason&lt;/em&gt;,
right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creepy. The compulsion to have tidy narrative is distracting, and
more severely, restraining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Travel is a state of mind. It has nothing to do with existence or the exotic. It is almost entirely an inner experience.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://binaryelysium.com/prose/theroux/brief.html#2&quot;&gt;Paul Theroux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flipping through pages of memory, rarely is it where I was or my reason
for being there that makes me pause and cherish the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, it is the people, the kind, gracious folks who bless me with all manner
of good will. They invite me into their homes, share their food,
their company, their troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the encounters are short, chance passings on the side of the road.
A water bottle kindly offered through a window by an outstretched
arm when I’ve used up my water rations earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other times, I stay for weeks or months, taking up residence in a spare room or on
a couch. Cooking meals, sharing laughter, developing true friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The where and the why are irrelevant details in these stories, mere
backdrop, &lt;em&gt;for these stories are about people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we go. I’ve found the framing for my story.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flying is not travel</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/10/13/daily.html" />

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Somewhere over the Atlantic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently some 30,000+ feet (9,000+ m) in the air on my &lt;em&gt;22nd plane&lt;/em&gt; in
4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in this post I’m going to come off as a spoiled brat, but, after all, it
is my journal. I reserve the right to rant occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sick of airplanes. Moving about in an airplane is not travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airplanes are a distortion of time and space. And you get frisked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Paul Theroux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…except in our great nation we prefer molestation. Straight up, full on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s my turn for the hallowed ritual (and it’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; my turn),
I choose to assert my right to receive my back-handed fondle in public, rather
then slink away to the private room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just my modest contribution to the absurdity of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120330/04122218301/how-tsas-security-theater-harms-us-all.shtml&quot;&gt;security theater&lt;/a&gt;:
making the polite TSA agent cup my balls in public. &lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s right
everyone! Look over here, this fellow’s job is to give me a firm rubdown in
front of your kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2012/10/patdown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Checking for crotch bombs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State sponsored groping is not what I set about to journal when I began with
the title “Flying is not travel,” but the flight attendants are serving dinner
and I have become quite worked up over a little friskiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to tuck the pen and notebook into the seat-back pocket and return to the
thought of “flying as travel” later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Year Later</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/10/08/a-year-later.html" />

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2012/10/08/a-year-later</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicahagy/2012/10/04/40-things-to-say-before-you-die/&quot; title=&quot;Serenity&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2012/10/serenity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Honesty + Integrity = Serenity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/23/coming-out-so-to-speak.html&quot;&gt;little over a year
ago&lt;/a&gt; I declared
my intent to extend my after-graduation trip indefinitely. At the time I didn’t
give much in the way of explanation for the decision, preferring to focus on my
fortune of having a geo-independent means to earn an income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I didn’t really understand my decision and what I wanted from such
a lifestyle. Oh, I certainly had a clear idea of things I did not want. I, not
so subtly, exclaimed my disgust at the traditional workplace environment:
cubicles, a commute, mind-numbing routine, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rebellious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Career?&lt;/em&gt; Phaw, a career is The Man’s instrument of slavery. &lt;em&gt;Success?&lt;/em&gt; Hah!
Success is the carrot society dangles in front of you while luring you into the
tar pit of debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lurking under the surface was a growing suspicion that I was just acting the
capricious twenty-something, discontent and trying desperately to live in my
own idealistic reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That suspicion gnawed at my insides for months, until it forced itself out of
my subconscious and manifested as guilt. Guilt at taking what I had been
generously bestowed in life, by my parents and mentors, and selfishly tossing
it out in a youthful gesture of insubordination. After all, the least
I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do to repay their essential contribution to my life is be
successful (i.e., great stable career, on the path to 2.5 kids and the white
picket fence), right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am, over a year later, and I’ve worked through that guilt. It
wasn’t easy, though in retrospect it was pretty silly. I’ll spare you the
cliché tortuous process of self-reflection, save a single thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your life is yours and, by my estimation, it’s the only one you’ve got. Don’t
let others expectations for you keep you from choosing happiness. If you talk
to those whose opinions you value, you might even find out what &lt;em&gt;you think&lt;/em&gt;
they expect of you is simply you projecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redefining success for myself and eschewing associated preconceptions was my
most important accomplishment of the past year. How did that year go? I’m
a recently graduated Computer Science major making a &lt;a href=&quot;http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/11poverty.shtml&quot; title=&quot;2011 Poverty Line in USA: $10,890&quot;&gt;tad more than the poverty
line&lt;/a&gt; when my average peer is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#TB_inline?height=325&amp;amp;width=325&amp;amp;inlineId=qf-wage&quot; title=&quot;US Dept. of Labor stats for Software Developers&quot;&gt;making over $90,000&lt;/a&gt;, but
measuring my self by that standard is ludicrous. Instead, I look at
what I’ve done that’s important to me and gauge progress according to those
values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t miss my point here. I would be the last to argue that a life of
homelessness, material minimalism, and radical autonomy is what everyone should
want in life, but those three principles are what make me happy (for now at
least). Yet, the notion of happiness and success we’re raised believing is the
opposite of those principles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; makes you happy? That’s what you should pursue and how you should measure
success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Where “we” is those of us in materialistic western societies. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summer's End</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/10/01/daily.html" />

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://binaryelysium.com/quechua/&quot;&gt;Quechua language study project&lt;/a&gt; was abruptly cut short in May when
a fantastic job opportunity presented itself. I abruptly packed up my little
life in Cusco and headed north to the USA for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve no regrets about leaving South America, I’ve left some loose ends
down there. First, I had a personal goal of crossing the continent on my bike,
but I only completed, perhaps, 25% before getting distracted by the Quechua
language and great friends in Cusco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, during the course of my Quechua study I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/04/20/daily.html&quot;&gt;a project to document
stories&lt;/a&gt; with recordings and transcripts online. I’ve tons of recorded
material to process and upload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not done with South America or Quechua. I’m comfortable with lettings
experiences come and, but this isn’t one of them. One of these days I’ll finish my
cycling tour, and continue my study of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my return stateside I’ve been visiting a bit of the USA. Kayaking in
Alaska, cycling in Colorado, and consulting work all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having refilled the coffers, so to speak, I’ll be headed back to Egypt in a few
weeks to brush up on my Arabic before beginning a Middle Eastern bike tour.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dead vs Living Stories</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Cusco, Peru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2012/04/kundur.jpg&quot; title=&quot;A Condor&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Andean Condor in flight (Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nospuds/381170650/&quot;&gt;Phil Robinson&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on a new project to record and release online native Quechua stories,
myths, parables, jokes, proverbs, etc. I released the first one yesterday. It
is a short story about a condor and his girl. You can listen to it and read
along in Quechua: &lt;a href=&quot;http://binaryelysium.com/quechua/audio/stories/kundur.html&quot;&gt;Kundur (The Condor)&lt;/a&gt;. English and Spanish
translations will be up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often decry the fact that Quechua is in decline, that tales and
traditions are being lost, as fewer and fewer children grow up speaking
Quechua.  By recording and making them available online, I feel that I’m doing
my small part to help preserve Quechua and its unique story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, in some contradictory way, I feel that, by recording and transcribing
stories, I’m also contributing to the decline of Quechua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For reference, the kinds of stories I’m referring to are tales, parables,
children’s stories, myths, etc.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strange thought occurred to me while editing a beautiful story, told from
memory by a young woman, who had many stories she couldn’t wait to tell me.
I realized I couldn’t think of any stories or myths from my culture. That
struck me as absurd. Surely, we have stories and myths? I mean,
I remember hearing them when I was a kid. Where did they all go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we have stories and myths (think Aesop’s fables and Grimm’s Fairy
Tales), but they’re all stuck in books. We invented writing and books, so our
shared cultural stories can’t ever be ‘lost’…right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, technically, with books–and now digitization–most of our cherished
stories from childhood won’t ever be lost. After all, that’s the problem of the
Quechua people today: they didn’t invent writing, and now they’re culture is
endanger of vanishing out from under us. It’s a mad dash to scribble down as
much history and culture as we can before the Westernization of their identity
is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--- We can&#39;t possibly capture an entire history and culture ??  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even as their stories are disappearing, they are still very much alive.
They are living, breathing, animated creatures, that change slightly every time
they’re told. They make their home in the heads of grandparents and their
grandchildren. What a fascinating life these stories have, not restricted by
their ‘canonical’ copies in some dusty tome, free to evolve and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stories are fixed in books, like beautiful vibrant butterflies pinned to
the pages of a child’s insect collection. Their colors have faded and they’ve
become crispy in our hands. Our stories have ‘right’ versions. Don’t dare
deviate from them or you’ll be ‘wrong’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s the price of preserving our stories. To save our stories we nail
them to the pages of books, where they become stationary and stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead stories are better than no stories, I suppose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that in mind, I do my best capturing the stories of the Quechua,
pinning them to paper and hoping that in the process I’m not wringing too much life out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cusco to Puerto Maldonado, 490km (bike) - Part 1</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/04/11/daily.html" />
   <published>2012-04-11T00:00:00+02:00</published>

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2012/04/11/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Cusco, Peru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Cusco after a 12 day trip to the jungle town of Puerto Maldonado. Six
of those twelve days were spent cycling up over the Andes to their very edge
and then down their steep backside all the way to the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun Statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance cycled:&lt;/strong&gt; 490km / 305mi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mountain passes crossed:&lt;/strong&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highest point:&lt;/strong&gt; 4,751 m / 15,587 ft&lt;br /&gt;
(higher than any point in the lower 48 USA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest point:&lt;/strong&gt; 0m / 0 ft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oddest camping spot:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;a graveyard&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;a rural school classroom&lt;/em&gt; (tie)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total crashes:&lt;/strong&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total spent:&lt;/strong&gt; $40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first cycling trip with a partner. Despite my initial apprehension,
the trip went smashingly well. I wasn’t concerned about my friend’s physical
fitness, she’s in great physical shape and has the steely willpower of
a warrior. Rather, I was uneasy that the sanctity of solo travel, as I’ve been
practicing for months now, would be marred by the presence of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, my fears were unfounded, in no small part because my partner
possesses that essential travel mojo that makes for the best traveling buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know these people, they’re relaxed, open-minded, and aren’t afraid to
compromise on the little stuff. They’re also strong, independent, and
can take care of themselves. Most importantly perhaps, they keep their heads
about them when shit goes down. And, boy, did shit go down this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Bronwyn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the morning of third day. Ahead of us is the final and highest pass in
our journey out of the Andes. Only 4,000 vertical feet stand between us and the
promised glorious downhill plunge into the jungle. Beginning outside the small
town of Ocangate, we amble along pleasantly through the valley, breakfast still
settling in our stomachs. The mood is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short time, the human influence on the land begins to fade away. The
fences penning the llama herds end, and the little scratches in the ground that
mark cultivated land peter out. The road changes as well; the gentle incline
has turned upward sharply. We are headed out of the valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rough and rugged landscape of the Andes far above the timber line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the road turns up, Bron and I’s chatter abruptly stops. We pause once more
to adjust our MP3 players, both choosing suitable auditory motivation.  My
choice is electronic music with a heavy, steady, and relentless beat. We each
settle into our own private place and push off towards the apex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM#!i=2056104369&amp;amp;k=dv3HKp6&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Up and Around&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-dv3HKp6/0/M/693162876279ac7fba74o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Up and Around&quot; alt=&quot;Up and Around&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve where the steep incline more or less began&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mountain is something you must climb alone. You might be accompanied by
others, but they don’t climb the mountain for you. Only you can bring yourself
to keep those pedals turning and your grip firm on the bars. The correct state
of mind takes you farther than physical prowess ever will. Pounding bass in
your ear to urge you forward doesn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue in silence and at our own pace for several hours, stopping every
few kilometers to sync up. Each bend in the road reveals more incline. It’s around
midday now and the weather is taking a turn. Dark ominous clouds roil overhead. We
turn one corner to see the road ahead disappear into a thick white wall of fog.
The temperature plummets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-nj8TDf6/0/M/69314590887586027ef5o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
It’s cold at wet at the top of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We press forward into the fog. A light frigid rain begins to spatter our coats.
Before long the rain transforms into a wet heavy sleet that smacks into your
face and melts, flooding down your neck as an unpleasant stream of frosty
water.  Unconsciously, we drift closer to each other, matching our paces. Who
wants to be alone in the dark chilly wetness in the middle-of-nowhere at the
top of everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not immune to the altitude. This high, oxygen is hard to come by.  The
instant you stop for breath, the icy bite you’ve been keeping at bay with
determined pedaling returns with a vengeance. You’re cold so you pedal faster,
which works for a short time, but you can’t sustain it at this altitude. Tired,
you stop to rest. A cunning trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point we pass three young children on the side of the road. We are miles
from anywhere, in horrible weather, and these children are walking down the
road as if coming home from school. The children (and their bloody mean dog)
stop and sit on the curb some 20 feet away and watch us attempting, rather
undextrously,  to peel a little mandarin orange. After we greedily snarf it
down (lunch-time had long since past and we’re running low on energy) I’m about
to start on our second one when I feel a twinge of guilt. Not seeing any orange
trees in the immediate proximity, I figure a sweet orange would be a nice
treat. After all, we will get out of this freezing situation and find more
oranges. I can’t say the same for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scuttle over and hand one of them the orange, attempting to make small talk
in Spanish and Quechua. They say nothing. I stare at them for a moment. An
eerie emptiness stares back. Then their dog goes utter apeshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrambling back onto my bike, we push off into the headwind, heads down,
pedaling furiously to outrun the dog berserking at our heels.  I toss
a glance over my head as we round a bend, the kids are still sitting there,
orange in hand, expressionless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several curves later we stumble across the sign indicating we’ve reached the summit.
Cold. Stark. Unassuming. We made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/25087460_4LbZFM#!i=2056104426&amp;amp;k=nj8TDf6&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Top of the WorldCold, wet and foggy.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cusco-to-Puerto-Maldonado/i-nj8TDf6/0/M/69314590887586027ef5o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Top of the WorldCold, wet and foggy.&quot; alt=&quot;Top of the WorldCold, wet and
foggy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triumph!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so passed the first challenge of the trip, or so we thought. Coming up
soon, more cold, piercing winds, scorching heat, and lots of blood (and
a little screaming).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2012/03/peru2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;My bicycle journey map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My slow, plodding bicycle journey so far. Green is on bike, red by bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost two months since I parked by bike in Cusco, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily.html&quot;&gt;got an
apartment&lt;/a&gt; and started
&lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/02/08/daily.html&quot;&gt;studying Quechua&lt;/a&gt;. Never did
I consider my biking journey through South America over, just temporarily on
hiatus. The culture, language, sights, and people of Cusco were just too enthralling to pass up. Not to mention I needed to get some serious work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I’m happy in Cusco, that I’m happy with my friends, and
that I’m happy studying Quechua, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html&quot;&gt;the
itch&lt;/a&gt; has been
gnawing at the back of my mind.  My bike
has been giving those depressing looks every morning
like a dog who hasn’t been walked in months. The road has been calling my name,  that wide black road that snakes up
the mountain side out of Cusco before dropping into the Sacred Valley following
the raging Urubamba River passing hundreds of years of Inca history in the
process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to take a vacation from Cusco. Next week is &lt;em&gt;Semana Santa&lt;/em&gt; (Easter
Week). Some friends and I are going to visit the jungle near the small town of
Puerto Maldonado some 500km from Cusco. Two of us are going to bike there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow the two of us leave for our 5 to 6 day journey. My sketchy map claims
we face two large passes 4100m (13,400 ft) and 4900m (16,000ft) in height
before the long gentle descent into the jungle at near sea level (180m/600ft).
The route is marked on the map above in purple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road leading from the Andes around Cusco to the jungle has historically
been a terrible and difficult, with the Lonely Planet describing it as “vile”
and “requir[ing] hardiness” (and that’s traveling by bus!). Since that
publication, however, the road is said to have been fully smoothed and paved.
They even gave it a fancy name: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoceanic_Highway&quot;&gt;Interoceanic
Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Usually I take
judgements about road conditions from locals with a grain of salt, but this
fellow has crossed the expanse in motorcycle 9 times. Though he thinks were
crazy to tackle those two passes on bike. He’s probably not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Relapsing into Routine (Cuzco, week 4)</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/02/08/daily.html" />

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Cuzco, Peru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

Armas and Cathedral, Cusco, Peru by szeke, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2338/2150533592_e250b1b3e7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; alt=&quot;Plaza de Armas and Cathedral, Cusco, Peru&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaza de Armas and Cathedral in Cuzco, Peru (by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/2150533592/&quot;&gt;Pedro Szekely&lt;/a&gt;
CC-SA-NC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s frightening how quickly I fall back into routine once I stop
moving. I’m not opposed to routines out of principal, on the contrary,
routines are comforting in their familiarity. They provide discipline and
structure which allows us to establish ~~good~~ habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, I find that when I’m constantly on the move, I let certain good habits
lapse: studying my languages, reading of news, communicating with my family.
However, I also pick up good habits that I find hard to maintain when
stationary: eating healthy, exercising, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, whenever I find myself in a routine, I grow wary and suspicious.
The warm snug familiarity of routine inevitable leads to thoughtless complacency, which
leads to boredom and missed opportunity. Life needs stimulus to stave off the
mundane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, though, the routine is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I embarked on my quest to study the Native (South) American language of Quechua (&lt;em&gt;kech-wa&lt;/em&gt;), the linga franca of the ancient Inca Empire. My daily routine
consists of consulting work, studying Quechua, and taking Quechua lessons.
Between those three, I theoretically should have little time to socialize,
yet, I’ve met many friendly and interesting people, mostly fellow
&lt;em&gt;gringos&lt;/em&gt;, but several locals as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still searching for a Peruvian near my own age with which to practice Quechua.
There are plenty of people here in Cuzco who speak Quechua, though most are older men
and women whom I speak with in taxis or in the markets.  My difficulties in finding
a younger conversation partner has inspired me to write an article about Quechua
and the difficulties it faces today. The unfortunate fact is that Quechua is a dying language. I will discuss the reasons for this and attempts to save it in this article, which
I will post soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime here is a long and boring video of my ride through downtown
Cuzco to the hostel I lived at for one week before moving to my apartment.
You can see the gorgeous Plaza de Armas, as well as the cute narrow little
streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long and mostly boring video of my ride from one hostel to another in Cuzco

   <title>Going Domestic in Cuzco</title>

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/26/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thrill of the unknown&lt;/em&gt;, that is, perhaps, for me, the essence of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow an open road that beckons with a sweet sultry strangeness into the
immense horizon, then to find yourself on the other end of that road in a novel
town, wheeling over the choppy cobblestone that you should appreciate as well-preserved colonial ambiance, yet can’t help but loathe as your teeth and sanity chatter out of your skull, ambling down street after street in this unknown place looking for an unknown destination where you can strip off those clothes encrusted in white layers of dried sweat, one layer for each day since your last icy cold shower like anthropomorphized tree rings, all the while dodging llama toting natives, creaky hand carts piled to the heavens with fresh colorful vegetables that put the surgically sorted shrink-wrapped cartons of genetically engineered greens and reds from your homeland to shame, and, don’t forget, the &lt;em&gt;put-put&lt;/em&gt;-ing mototaxis that swarm around you in a choking cloud of black exhaust like metal bees from some Industrial Revolution era experiment gone horribly wrong; to lose yourself in this otherness, in this now-ness, with no intentions other than to keep moving, this is the essence of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a certain comfort in &lt;em&gt;the known&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one can’t deny the mundane pleasure that comes from seeing familiar
faces, such as the little old lady’s craggy face that is split by a large
broken-toothed smile, as you approach in the neighborhood market to buy your three dollars of weekly produce. You’re no longer just another well off &lt;em&gt;gringo&lt;/em&gt;, emissary from the land of iPads and flip-flops, but you have a name and a small loyalty, for a time at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the comfort derived from a reliably hot (if not reliably flowing) shower and a familiar bed cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not matter how slowly you go as long as
you do not stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Confucius&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m slowing down for a stretch in Cuzco, Peru. This involves breaking my minimalist
tradition and obtaining a few things: an apartment, roommates, and a real
towel. But I’m not calling Cuzco home, rather I’m temporarily taking advantage of the
location to indulge another hobby of mine: language learning. This week
I started studying Quechua, the native language of the Incas and second
official language of Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the bike saddle and into the classroom. I can’t help but wonder how long it will be before the road, that irresistible temptress, seduces me back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>One Month in Peru</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/04/daily.html" />
   <published>2012-01-04T00:00:00+01:00</published>
   
   <updated>2012-01-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   
   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2012/01/04/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From: Huaraz, Peru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2012. Over a month has passed since my last entry, though don’t mistake
the silence for inactivity. Quite a bit happened
the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the border, my hands were a blistery mess secreting a vile
pus, thanks to the rough dirt roads and my lack of an adequate front
suspension. As much as I wanted to continue on by bike, the sharp gut-wrenching
pain radiating from my palms precluded any attempt to secure a strong grip on
the handlebars. Instead, I attached myself, my bike, and 4 bags to a group of
three swell Germans who arrived by bus. The next two weeks were spent in
their convivial company traveling around Northern Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too lazy to go into detail about the following period, though I’ll do the math
for you: in those 4 weeks of December I cycled a mere 3 days. For all my
diligent stalkers out there here was my route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La Balsa (border) to Chachapoyas (collectivo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chachapoyas to Leymebamba (bike, 1 day, 80km)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leymebamba to Cajamarca (bus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cajamarca to Trujillo (bike, 2 days, 285km)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trujillo to Lima (bus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lima to Trujillo (bus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still scribbled a bit in my journal every couple days, every time
I attempted to muster up the motivation to write more I found
a convenient distraction. Often, the process of putting to paper coherent and connected
sentences from the turbulent nebula of my thoughts resembles an undesired chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-QMH9D73/0/M/6714703861c450baedb6o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Winding slowly down the mountains outside Cajamarca. The road snakes off into the distance towards the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two day, 285km bike ride from Cajamarca in the Andes to Trujillo on the
 coast was gorgeous. Starting at 8,900 ft
 (2,700m) you climb over 2,400ft (750m) before starting the long windy descent
 towards the coast. The scenery gradually changes from mountain scrub to desolate desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-V2XpjRV/0/M/671469864199965d989bo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Fixing a flat in the hot barren desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Trujillo I stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas, a place famous among everyone
 whose cycled in South America. Lucho, a retired racing cyclist, has been
 opening his house to traveling cyclists for over 25 years. He provides a bed,
 shower, and great company for as along as you want, &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. I took
 advantage of his hospitality for a week and spent the New Years with Lucho and
 his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/25087475_ZS56TD&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Peru/Peru-Cajamarca-to-Trujillo/i-8tgTn2s/0/M/67147031753433d7c29fo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The House of Cyclists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning after arriving in Trujillo I hopped on a bus for the 10 hour
journey to Lima to visit a good ‘ol friend from Ecuador who was heading back
to the USA with her tail between her legs. Guess she couldn’t handle the
awesomeness that was Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas in Lima. Bus back to Trujillo. Stayed at the Casa de Ciclistas. New
Years in Trujillo. Hello 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Zumba, Ecuador to Peru, 45km (bike)</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/12/01/daily.html" />

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/12/01/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; San Ignacio, Peru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a day! Left early from Progreso after thanking the nice family profusely
and forcing them to take a few dollars compensation.
They let me fill up my three water bottles from their hose.
There is no real plumbing in these areas, so for water they harness a natural
spring and attach a hose to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final gesture of kindness they gave me some sweet sugar covered &lt;em&gt;empañadas&lt;/em&gt; to snack on during the day. I didn’t tell them that bread carbs weren’t really my thing. Smile. Nod. &lt;em&gt;Gracias a ustedes, muy amable!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Progreso it was about 10km to Zumba, but it was the next valley over,
which meant a 3ish hour climb on more bad roads. I still can’t believe this
entire southeast portion of Ecuador is without paved roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb was relatively easy. I listened to some podcasts I had downloaded in
Vilcabamba. Got mostly caught up on international and economic news.
Egypt is finally having their elections! Atrocious things are happening in
Syria, still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coasted into Zumba just before noon as rain started pouring. I camped out in an
Internet cafe for 30 minutes waiting for the rain to pass. It didn’t. Went to
a restaurant and ate a meal. Still raining. Around one PM I knew I needed
to get going if I wanted to make it to the border. Set out for the last 35km of
my Ecuadorian journey in a nasty downpour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five km from Zumba I got a flat. The road was covered in broken glass hidden
under wet mud. Patching a tube in the rain is… an experience. I was filthy
when finished, mud everywhere, soaking wet. Oh well, adventure right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7JdNWfD/0/M/64680950418e8a2a0d6co-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Changing a flat in rain and mud. Why doesn’t it look so bad in this photo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five km later the same tire was flat again. The patch I had just applied wasn’t
working, apparently I need to practice my patching-in-the-rain skills. Screw it.
Ripped out the tube and put in a fresh spare. I’ll fix this one (if I can?)
later when I’m somewhere dry and warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some indeterminate amount of time later the rain stopped and I was treated to
a colorful after-rain sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-wdVvq8Q/0/M/6468099847fbdf854ea2o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
After the rain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point a taxi passed me with a blonde-haired gringo hanging out the
window waving. It was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smilingaway.com&quot;&gt;old Swedish friend&lt;/a&gt; from Cuenca/Vilcabamba on his way to Peru as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time passed. It is hard to believe I did less than 30 miles today, it took
almost all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before officially crossing into Peru there is a tiny control point signifying
the end of Ecuador. They took my passport, did some stuff with it, asked me
some questions, and let me fill up my water bottles. Adios!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-7jkkZhC/0/M/6468121799ff1b1aa352o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The tiny control point with two guards and my bike. Ecuador is back down that road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last several km from the control to the actual border was some of the worst
terrain of this trip so far. Horribly steep grades (both up and down) littered with potholes and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN#!i=2056101947&amp;amp;k=gsgQjxd&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=M&quot;&gt;border between Peru and
Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; is a small river over which is built
a small bridge with the only pavement for hundreds of km on either side. The
descent down to the bridge is jarring and contains all the aforementioned features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands hurting (more blisters) and legs tired, I rested on the Ecuadorian side to enjoy a last Pilsner (an Ecuadorian beer). It was warm, but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the most laidback border crossing I’ve ever seen. No police. No
officials. After my beer I just rolled my bike over the bridge into Peru. From
that point I could have kept going, for there was no one to stop me, but
I figured it was prudent to search out someone to give me an entrance stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-4pqfbCD/0/M/64681125975cde47e6feo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
30 feet of sweet pavement between Peru and Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Peruvian migration officer is found in a little red building 50ft from the
bridge in an unlabeled room. He was sleeping on a cot behind his desk. I gave
him a friendly nudge. He awoke right away and happily began the paperwork. Many
questions were asked about my plans and my journey, and the exchange was going
well until he went to stamp my passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantically flipping through the pages of my passport he began demanding where
my &lt;em&gt;sello&lt;/em&gt; was. &lt;em&gt;Sello&lt;/em&gt;? No idea what this is. He became even more blustered
when I asked for an explanation. He held up a rubber stamp from his deck and
practically screamed &lt;em&gt;SELLO!!&lt;/em&gt;. Oh. Where was my Ecuadorian exit stamp?
Somewhere in there, those two guards at the control (remember that?) had done
something with my passport, they must have stamped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t there. I didn’t have an Ecuadorian exit stamp. The Peruvian migration official was convinced I was attempting to escape Ecuador illegally. In my most sincere and polite Spanish, I promised I wasn’t and I would go straight back to Ecuador and find that stamp. Cross my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out those two guards hadn’t given me a stamp, and they weren’t supposed
to. I have no idea what they did with my passport. Anyways, right on the
Ecuadorian side of the bridge was a migrations office where a policeman was
supposed to dole out these oh-so-important stamps. The office was empty. The
stamp was sitting right there on the desk… why.. I could just pick it up
and…Oh, did I ever consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resisting the urge to stamp myself into Ecuador, I asked a kid outside where I might find
the &lt;em&gt;Policia&lt;/em&gt;. She pointed me towards the river, where I found 6 shirtless guys
playing an extremely intense and serious game of volleyball. Practically
shoving myself in the middle of the game, I politely inquired which of these
fine sweaty chaps had the authority to let me out of Ecuador. A tall, bronze
muscular one waved and made the universal hand sign motion for “&lt;em&gt;5 more minutes&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 45 minutes I watched the game. Interesting to watch, yes,
but I was rather annoyed and ready to get leave Ecuador. Every couple serves the
policeman would say sorry and motion for 5 more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was fierce. Ecuadorians are serious about their volleyball. About
a dozen onlookers from the village had come to spectate. Finally it was over.
The policeman’s team had won. He was in a cheery mood as we walked to the
office. Dripping sweat all over the desk he handed me the stamp and
said I should do it myself so he doesn’t get sweat on my passport. Why, thanks
&lt;em&gt;señor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stamped myself out of Ecuador and recrossed the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now convinced I’m on the up and up, the same Peruvian officer readily stamps my
passport with a 180 day tourist visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello Peru!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thus concludes my time in Ecuador. I really enjoyed my 8 months here. I highly
recommend it to anyone visiting South America. Feel free to ask me anything
about it in comments or email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Progreso, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke early. Slept soundly aside from a strange dream where my hidden camping
spot was invaded by dozens of gypsies traveling in covered wagons painted in
bright colors. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stepped into the dawn
I half wondered where the gypsies had gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broke camp quickly, packed up my bike and headed back onto the steep rough
road. Not even 1km in I got my first flat. I’ve been using slime tubes, tubes
filled with a neon green slime that helps fills punctures. So, if I got a real
flat, then the puncture must be pretty large. Sure enough, I found a large
puncture, but it was quickly patched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-K8Z9BCg/0/M/646808342564414dbf96o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Changing the first flat tire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few km after the patch I was running low on water, having indulged in 3 cups
of coffee this morning. I stopped shortly to fill my bottle up from a small clear waterfall. The mountain water was clear and tasted fresh. I filtered it quickly, though later in the day I filled up twice more and didn’t filter. We’ll see if I get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-gk99LFC/0/M/646810569309dd78358bo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Filling up on mountain water from a small waterfall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 or 6 more km I peaked the pass, where I could see far into the horizon.
The descent that followed turned out to be more grueling than the ascent. My
bike is not a mountain bike, the biggest consequence of this means I do not
have shocks. Racing down rough dirt and rocky roads with plenty of switchbacks
is not comfortable. Just 30 minutes in my hands were starting to develop
blisters from my vice like grip on the brakes. By the end of the day my hands
hand blistered, popped, and re-blistered several times. The pain was so intense
I could barely hold on the the handlebars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-JSC4hkp/0/M/6468096427a1bdb185beo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The view before the bouncy and hand torturing descent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passed through the small villages of Valladolid and Palanda. Stopped in Palanda
for a quick lunch and resupply (more tuna). Didn’t quite make it to Zumba,
despite the relatively easy and fast-going flat terrain in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped in dusk at the tiny (less than 50 people) village of Progreso
20km before Zumba. There
were no restaurants, stores, or hostels, so I was going to ride out of town to
camp somewhere, but a kind local family fed me dinner and let me sleep in a spare bed. Apparently cyclists pass through that village often without stopping, and they were interested in my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Peru!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; A tent on the road to Zumba, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the first leg of my journey to the Zumba/La Balsa border crossing with
Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left Vilcabamba late in the morning after a leisurely coffee (or two) and
a brief shopping expedition for food supplies. It is difficult to keep a high
caloric intake when biking 8-10 hours a day and the feeling of intense hunger
is very distracting, so taking the right snacks is important. Today in Vilcabmaba I was lucky to find all-natural
peanut butter (aka ground peanuts) and coconut oil, two high-protein and
high-calorie foods. I use bread as a hand-to-mouth food delivery device. For
dinner it will be tuna and mayonnaise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-bxtftsD/0/M/6468093215b9e99afd53o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Taking a high-calorie snack break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road out of Vilcabamba was a steady incline that went through some intense
road construction. Apparently, a Chinese company is opening a mine in the area,
and they need to widen the roads to make room for the large dump trucks. The
road was very muddy and I got bogged down in about 300m of mud. It took about
30 minutes to drag my load to the dry dirt on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5km out of Vilcabamba the construction and dirty roads cleared up, and
I enjoyed smooth pavement for 10km more or so. The landscape consisted of
rolling hills covered in green and dotted with shrubs and short trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-w6Dx6kQ/0/M/6468082031387da839a0o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The landscape about 15km outside of Vilcabamba, looking back on the route taken&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point during the day I passed the little &lt;em&gt;pueblo&lt;/em&gt; of Yangana. There
weren’t any open restaurants, so I just drove through. A kind man stopped me
and told me there weren’t any other villages for another 55km over two 
mountain passes. When I told him I wasn’t worried, I had a tent and food, he gave me that (unfortunately) familiar look that says &lt;em&gt;you’re-obviously-off-your-rocker-so-I’m-going-to-back-away-slowly-and-smile&lt;/em&gt;. I thanked him for his advice and pedaled up the steep hill out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Yangana the pavement ended abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-HPNG6NC/0/M/6468141639dc5e900724o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Into the rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the rough road corresponded with the beginning of the first
mountain pass. Several km in the pavement started
again as abruptly as it had ended, but only on one half of the two-lane road
(they’re working on surfacing the road).
Thankfully it lasted until the summit, where the road turned into a steep
downhill packed-dirt surface. I don’t expect to see smooth roads again until
Peru, some several hundred km ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate carrying a watch. I deliberately don’t carry one when riding; it’s a little extra rebellion against civilization. The only times I need to know are “&lt;em&gt;Is it hungry time?&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Is it sleeping time?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I descended the first (small) pass and started up the next into Podocarpus
National Park, the sun was
racing towards the horizon. Looking at my personal watch, the lone hand was
pointing squarely between “sleeping-o-clock” and “hungry-o-clock”, also known
as “keep-going-thirty.” So, I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road was single-laned, cliff-mountain road covered in loose dirt and large
loose rocks. In a few portions it was killer steep. Not the kind of terrain my
half-bald tires can get traction on. Pushed about 300m total here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while later, my clock hand was cruising towards “sleeping-o-clock”, so
I began looking for a camping spot. The thing about mountain cliff roads, is
that, on one side you have a cliff wall, and on the other side you have a cliff
drop-off. No shoulder. Camping in the road was briefly on the table, but the
committee voted against that proposition; although, it was a close vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fog was rolling in (seriously Andes, what’s with the fog at dusk? It’s like
a bad horror movie) when I found a small enclave off the side of the road near
the cliff. Enough space to hide my bicycle and tent. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 45km (approx) today, felt like more. No rain. No mechanical problems.
Sweet camping spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/25087433_zMz5fN&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Vilcabamba-to-Peru/i-XhGdPF9/0/M/6468140441fd5035648ao-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
My tent in Parque Nacional Podocarpus near the cliff. Behind that fog is a gorgeous view of the valley and nearby mountains, of course I only took a picture of the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vilcabamba, Ecuador (day 18)</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/11/28/daily.html" />

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/11/28/daily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Vilcabamba, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three weeks of biking along the sun-drenched coast of Ecuador, sucking
down coconut juice freshly freed from the husk by overly eager men with
machetes, following around cute and intriguing &lt;em&gt;artesanias&lt;/em&gt;, and camping along
sandy bleached beaches, it was time stop for awhile and get some work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent several days in Cuenca, but the new client wasn’t quite ready for the
project to begin. So, I hightailed it to Loja in a two-day 200km sprint over
several mountain passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend from Quito insisted Loja wasn’t particularly noteworthy, and if
I was going to sit in front of a computer for hours on end, I should do it in
a place with a view. So, 18 days ago I left Loja for the little village of
Vilcabamba (Sacred Valley).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/11/dan-vista.jpg&quot; title=&quot;View of Vilcabamba&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View from my &#39;office&#39; these past weeks. Photo by my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=243678582361736&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was right about the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks I’ve been working hard; I put in over 50 hours this week. My
temporary residence has been the the gorgeous hostel of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.izhcayluma.de/&quot;&gt;Izhcayluma&lt;/a&gt;.
It is probably the best marketed hostel in all of Ecuador. Nearly everyone I’ve
met in Ecuador has recommended it. In addition to the steady stream of travelers making their way south or north
who stopover for a few days (or more) in Izhcayluma, people seem to come from
all over the world just to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/11/bike-izh.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/11/bike-izh-s.jpg&quot; title=&quot;My Bike at Izhcayluma&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posing after arriving at Izhcayluma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve worked most of every day, invariably I took a break well past dark
to eat dinner and socialize with the current crop of guests. Three days seems
to be the time between turnovers, that is, the time after which I look up from
my computer, wipe the glaze off my eyes, and see all new faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve met hundreds of people in my few weeks here, and, I would like to say, all
with interesting stories, but the truth is after the first week the stories all
start to sound the same. Though every couple days there is that one old man with great
tales of adventure from his youth or that young guy riding from Alaska to
Argentina on his motorcycle. I don’t mean to devalue anyone’s experiences, but
the unfortunate fact is &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html&quot; title=&quot;The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride a bike&quot;&gt;it has all been done before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are interesting, every one of us, but among travelers travel
stories can be a bit repetitive. When faced with the inevitable hostel dinner
conversation (&lt;em&gt;“How long have you
been traveling? Wow! Where are you going? That’s cool. How much longer do you
have?”&lt;/em&gt; etc.) I try to steer the conversation to something else: politics, pop
culture, technology, work, life, anything but travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That mini-rant out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I’ve met some awesome people and had great times. My ping pong game has seriously improved. As nice as Izhcayluma is (both in price and atmosphere)s, today I woke up with that itch. It’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomorrow I leave for Peru.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I head in the direction of Peru. I suspect it will take me two days to
reach the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m taking the remote border crossing of Zumba - La Balsa, a remote and seldom
used crossing in the east of Ecuador/Peru. Remote and seldom used, because the
road is one-lane unpaved, dirt and gravel for hundreds of kilometers through
steep and windy mountain passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?!&lt;/em&gt;, I ask myself,  am I taking the most difficult route into Peru? Well, there
are some legitimate reasons such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid the dirty, busy, and dangerous Pan Americana highway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid the central-northern part of Peru which is miles of tedious desert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See some gorgeous vistas as I wind my way through the Andes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, ultimately, these are merely happy bonuses. The truth is that taking
the road less traveled on my definitely-not-a-mountain bike and spending weeks alone braving rain and muddy roads is exactly the sort of discomfort that makes for a good adventure. Maybe I have some underlying masochistic tendencies, though I prefer to frame it in the old adage &lt;abbr title=&quot;Oh, god, how cliche of me&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;No Pain, No Gain&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a bumpy ride.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Loja, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early morning in the little village of Oña. As much as I would like to roll out
of bed into my bike and down the road, I’m a slave to little morning rituals,
mostly involving coffee. This morning was no exception. Made some coffee in my
stove outside the Hotel, and shared a few cups with the owner, Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was interested in my travels, mainly concerning what my family thought about
me traveling alone. We had an interesting discussion about the differences
between American and Ecuadorian culture regarding the importance of family. He
was quite surprised that I was one of only two children. His old face, gouged
and cracked from a lifetime of hard work, split into a wide, proud grin as he
exclaimed that he had had 8 sons and 2 daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I packed up my bike with its four panniers (bike bags) on each wheel, he watched intently
from the driveway. Giving me an astonished look, he asked how I stored my computers in such little space. The night before I had told him I was a &lt;em&gt;ingeniero sistemas&lt;/em&gt; (‘computer engineer’, sort of), and he had taken that to mean I sold computers (like a traveling computer salesman). I attempted to explain that I didn’t sell anything physical, but rather sold this immaterial substance called ‘software’. Nodding heavily as if he was beginning to grasp the concept, he delicately asked if he could see some of this ‘software’ and wondered where I sold it. Unfortunately, my Spanish was just not up to the task of explaining that I sold intangible, invisible items at a phantasmic global market called the ‘Internet.’ I expect that would be difficult even in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-rRDGzzF/0/M/633797907494bcf4f83co-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Antonio’s hotel in Oña. He was a bit shy for a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit the road around 8am for the second leg of the journey from
Cuenca to Loja. The weather was kinder today, blue skies with puffy white
clouds covered me most of the day providing some gorgeous vistas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-6h9ztHq/0/M/6351183644f2d6d371d6o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Road and Skies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevation change was more extreme than yesterday. I lost count of the number of
passes traversed. The day was a series of long, sustained climbs, followed by exhilarating, but oh so short, descents through windy mountain roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gravity giveth, and gravity taketh away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding in mountainous terrain has made me realize that patience and a steely
resolve are crucial when overcoming obstacles. With sufficient patience and
determination, I feel like I could do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped in the small town of Saraguro for lunch. Rice, beans, and chicken:
standard Ecuadorian fare. Can’t wait for Peru, if just for a change in food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near dusk, fog settled in. By that time I had been riding for about 9 hours and was thoroughly fatigued. Fog riding is mentally taxing. There is the extra attention that 
must be paid to vehicles and obstacles, yet more onerous is the visual
deprivation. You lose the sensation of progress, of forward movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to reach Loja today, I rode into dark (in retrospect, not particularly smart). If fog riding in daylight is mentally taxing, doing the same, but in darkness, is punishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode for what seemed liked hours into the impenetrable blackness. I pulled out every mental trick I knew to force my legs to keep pumping and hands to keep gripping, until all thought fled and only raw instinctual movement remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was a mindless toil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white line on black pavement was the only thing visible, a barely perceptible beacon of hope promising a way out of the void that had swallowed me. Dutifully, I followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in a quiet moment–indistinguishable from those just passed–I road out of the murky vapor into a nocturnal mountainside. Beneath me, bathed in a purple light diffused through the mist, was the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an immense sigh that shuddered throughout everything. In that moment I found myself–but the sigh spent itself, the moment passed, and silence reigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-L8t8LJf/0/M/6351184758ff248ed51fo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pointed my bike downhill and the silence was spoiled by the soft sound of
cool wind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Oña, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading from Cuenca to Loja today: 205km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departed from my hostel (Posado del Rio) in Cuenca around 7am after chatting it up with some other early risers over a cup of coffee. Navigation out of the city was easy enough using a map one of the lovely Hostel owners had given me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10km or so out of Cuenca along level gray pavement lies the medium sized village of Cumbe. Stopped there to pick up some supplies in case I ended up wild camping in the mountains ahead. Tuna and mayonnaise, the perfect combination. Plenty of fat and protein to keep me going. Canned tuna keeps forever, as does this Ecuadorian mayo that doesn’t require refrigeration (or so they tell me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stumbled across the &lt;em&gt;mercado&lt;/em&gt; (open air market with cheap adhoc restaurants),
and ended up relaxing for a bit for some more coffee and friendly conversation
with the locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-4f4G24p/0/M/6337971148fe40d1610eo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Whole roasted hog. Fresh all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed a man with a bicycle cart proffering a
beverage in old grimy wine bottles. Curious, I asked to try a bit, to which he
responded by handing me a full (12oz) cup. The mysterious piping hot beverage was the
color of maple syrup, with the same consistency, and tasted like, well, plants. It wasn’t an unpleasant taste, mind you, but it wasn’t sweet. Only then did it occur to me to ask what it was: &lt;em&gt;aguardiente&lt;/em&gt; (lit. “fiery water”, sugarcane liquor) in agave (the cactus) juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and that was how I came to be pedaling out of Cumbe with a not-so-trifling buzz at
8am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Cumbe the road quickly turned uphill as I headed for my first, of several, 12,000 foot mountain passes. An hour or so into my ascent I stopped to rest on the
curb, and struck up a conversation with an ancient farmer, with skin like aged
brown leather and a sprightly step, tending to his mountain-side field. He
assured me with the utmost compassion that my ascent was almost over,
“&lt;em&gt;media hora en bicicleta, no mas&lt;/em&gt;”, no more than half an hour to go by bike. Tossing a grateful “&lt;em&gt;muchas gracias, adios señor!&lt;/em&gt;” over my shoulder I pushed off with a renewed vigor. This mountain was mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two and a half hours later I reached what I suppose to be the summit, as instead
of constant uphill the terrain it morphed into rolling hills. I had a banana
to celebrate my victory and resolved not to ask locals about the length of ascents again. The mental deception is too taxing; just concentrate on the road you can see in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-ndSZLPk/0/M/633796976214bfd89d28o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Cheers! First mountain pass of the day conquered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I had left Cuenca I had been fleeing from ominous storm clouds; around
1pm they caught me. With the cold, harsh rain came a dense gray fog. The following several hours were some of the most thrilling riding I’ve done. Screaming down mountain passes, taking curves with 10 feet of visibility, all the while squinting in pain through the cold torrent, is a singular experience. Several hoots and hollers were belted out in my adrenaline filled furor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/25087823_jkdcH6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca-to-Vilcabamba/i-NPMZM8j/0/M/633797765267000b551eo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Right before the rain came the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the rain and fog passed as I descended about 3,300 ft into a village, only to find another 3,500 foot ascent waiting for me. This time around I was chasing the sun into dusk. Determined to summit before dark, I pushed on; a multicultural medley of Spanish, English, and Arabic curse words carried me to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knees wrung, thighs cramping, and mental faculties slightly unhinged I drifted the last four or five miles in a giddy delirium to the small pueblo of Oña (200 people) where I staggered up one final dirt hill to the only hotel and into bed as the sun sunk behind the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half way to Loja. 100km down, 105km more to go. Tomorrow is looking to be more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Cuenca, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuenca is a gorgeous city (even when it is raining).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/25087492_6XqkGp&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/i-5nTzt8X/0/M/6264740057ce4454604fo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
In Cuenca’s main plaza (photo by my friend Kate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuenca, however, is not a city for bicycles. If it isn’t the lumpy
centuries-old cobblestone rattling the teeth right out of your skull, then it
is the villainous truck/bus drivers who have some sort of elaborate, callous
plan to rid their streets of cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More work today. Took the bike out for a short spin to do some errands (ATM,
coffee, spare nuts ‘n bolts), hence the mini rant. Leaving tomorrow bright and early, that is the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Salinas to Cuenca (bus)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Cuenca, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday I left Salinas for Cuenca. By bus. I feel guilty for having skipped over
400km in just a few hours, when I’m supposed to by cycling across South
America, not “cycling most of the time, but when I get lazy I take a bus too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I’m not torn up about it. The fact is I want to get to Peru sooner,
and some tentative plans I had to do the Galapagos on the cheap fell through.
Turns out taking a cargo ship from Guayaquil to the Galapagos is as expensive
as flying. Bummed, I won’t be able to see Janet, Wendy, or John over there.
Wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/25087492_6XqkGp&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Cuenca/i-c3xshsH/0/L/6264740255dabef617e9o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Sunday was spent on a bus. Arrived in Cuenca around 5pm. While I had been
here before, I wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood near the bus station. Once
again I implemented my strategy of pedaling off in a good looking direction.
Once again that strategy proved fruitful, in about 30 minutes I found downtown
Cuenca. (reminder to self: patent this brilliant method)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I remembered the way to one of my favorite hostels: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hosteltrail.com/posadadelriocuenca/&quot; title=&quot;Posada del Rio&quot;&gt;Posada del Rio&lt;/a&gt;. This place rocks. Fantastic kitchen, lots of
tableware, cooking utensils, and most importantly a giant stove with 6 burners.
In a busy hostel, with tons of people cooking, the kitchen can get crowded.
Superb wifi (also available in the rooms). A large spacious common area. Clean,
cozy-yet-not-too-cozy-if-you-know-what-i-mean dorms. Best of all is the crowd
it tends to attract: budget travelers who aren’t afraid to come out of their
shells. Nearly every night there’s a large group dinner as people pool
their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it rained. All day. Didn’t go out, except to scrounge up some grub.
Took advantage of the fast Internet to do some much needed work. I’m getting
used to being that weirdo in the corner on the computer all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a mini Lord of the Rings marathon in the evening with a Frenchman and two
Canadian girls. Itching to get back on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Salinas, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set out early. Thanked the nice owner of the hosteria that let me pitch my tent
for free. Tried to pay her a few dollars, but she wasn’t having any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped after about 10mi for some breakfast at a little cabana along the beach.
Eggs, coffee, and some wind blown sand.. mmmmhmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the little mountain pass outside Puerto Lopez, the terrain has been more or
less flat. Riding into the urbanized area of La Libertad and Salinas was quite
a change from the calm rural riding of the past couple days. Lots of vehicles,
lots of exhaust. Egh. Do not like riding in urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rode around Salinas for several hours. I really had no clue where I was or where I was going. That proved to be a solid plan, because I happened across a nice little place called “&lt;em&gt;Hospedaje Beach Camping&lt;/em&gt;”. They
weren’t really on the beach, but they had a nice courtyard to setup my tent in.
Hot showers, shared bathroom, security, $4. Slightly expensive, but a huge
Ecuadorian holiday is just ending, so the price would’ve been lower had
I arrived a day later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placed my tent adjacent to a tent belonging to a nice Uruguayan couple traveling north. We exchanged tips about good camping sites, and couch surfing contacts. Got a preview of the crazy Spanish accent awaiting me when I get down to Argentina and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the official conclusion of the &lt;em&gt;Ruta del Sol&lt;/em&gt; portion of my bike
tour. The Ecuadorian coast is beautiful, full of friendly happy people, yummy seafood, and plenty of sun. The roads are in great condition. Most of the route had shoulders. In those stretches without shoulders, drivers were courteous and respectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still haven’t finalized plans for what comes next. Will do that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Salinas, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally dragged myself out of Puerto Lopez today. Five (six? I lost count) days
there was way more than I should have spent. Though, the combination of people,
sun, sand, and ocean was just too difficult to decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought a bracelet from one of the artesanias. It has my alma mater’s colors,
which is probably why it caught my eye, because my school spirit isn’t particularly fierce. A little token for remembering, something I’m also usually not so keen on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was well past 2pm when I started the ascent out of town up that big hill
to the south I had been eyeing all week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056132721&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-FsnVvV3/0/M/63204212006fbd6d3410o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Looking back on Puerto Lopez from the hill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that hill I didn’t expect to make it far,
especially because of a small mountain pass about 20mi away. Surprisingly,
despite the fact my legs turned to flub after 5 days of beach living, I made it
a solid 40mi, well past the mountain pass. No pictures from that giant uphill
ride. Buses cutting into the nonexistent shoulder and savage dogs
attempting to take chunks from my calves, didn’t leave much opportunity for
photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road about an hour into dark. First time night riding in Ecuador, wouldn’t
recommend it. There weren’t any suitable wild camping spots, so I road along in
my red and white blinking glory until I chanced upon a small &lt;em&gt;hosteria&lt;/em&gt; in
Colonche. They didn’t have any rooms, but &lt;em&gt;la senora&lt;/em&gt; graciously allowed me to setup my tent in an open space out front. For free! Tuna fish with mayonnaise for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Puerto Lopez, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visited Isla de la Plata yesterday. It is a little island covered in scrub
about 1 hour from Puerto Lopez by boat. Some call it the poor man’s Galapagos
Islands, for it possible to a small handful of species there that also reside
on the Galapagos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite enjoyable, even though it was the dry season, so most of the
island’s vegetation was dry and dead. Saw &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of blue footed boobies, many of
which had nested right on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-8ZdR9p9/0/M/63066169230f29fb4a5fo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two blue-footed boobies and their chick&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Two blue-footed boobies and their chick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the island a pod of dolphins followed us for a way, frolicking in
the surf kicked up by our skiff. In the bay we also caught site of a cute, lonely, sea turtle who was interested in the side of our boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-ZKNbpwW/0/M/6307136562aecbd2204do-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A curious sea turtle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, spent several hours working and reading, then spent the evening
hanging out in the village’s main plaza with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/11/01/daily.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;artesanias&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned last time. They are a fun and laid-back
group. I admire their freedom. No ties to one place, no societal obligations.
Liberty requires living with the barest essentials, a purposeful absence of
possessions and relationships. It is a truly selfish state of being. Freedom isn’t for everyone. Is it for me? Don’t I want to &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Puerto Lopez, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Lopez is a small fishing village on the Pacific coast. Yesterday, just
after dawn, I went down to the beach as the fishermen were pulling in from their long
night of fishing. Saw some pretty cool catches: little hammerhead sharks, big
colorful tunas, and even a 7-foot long shark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d#!i=2056131584&amp;amp;k=F9RTsvq&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=A&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-F9RTsvq/0/S/63066146097cd7408030o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended up working the rest of the morning and afternoon, then rode my bike around town in the evening. They don’t celebrate Halloween here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met some interesting travelers on the beach last night: Two girls, Canadian and
Chilean, traveling
separately and alone, who make artisanal crafts (necklaces, little bags,
bracelets, etc) from beads, hemp, bone, shells, etc. When I ran across them they were picking up shells from the beach to use in their creations. They wander from place to place, setting up little tables in the center of towns to sell their art. They live on less than $10 per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a tough life, but it isn’t easy either. Ignoring the fact I have no creative inclinations in that regard, if I couldn’t work over the Internet, I could easily see myself ending up like them to support a nomadic lifestyle. Maybe I would be the wandering computer repair hobo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m taking a little tour to &lt;em&gt;Isla de la Plata&lt;/em&gt; (Island of Silver), also
known as the Poor man’s Galapagos, to see a few species of animals found on the
Galapagos islands. Birds, sea turtles, and with luck some dolphins and perhaps 
a whale.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Puerto Lopez, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short ride today. After two days of riding past gorgeous beaches, I’m stopping
in Puerto Lopez for several days to enjoy the surf, and see some local sights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found a great hostel (Hostel Maxima) 1 block from the beach. The kind owners graciously
allowed me to setup my tent in the large grassy courtyward for only $2 per night with access to the shared
bathrooms, kitchen, and oh-so-important WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Puerto Cayo, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first official day on the &lt;em&gt;Ruta del Sol&lt;/em&gt; (Route of the Sun), the
coastal route along Ecuador’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up early. Had some horrible instant coffee and a plate of eggs with cheese
at a little restaurant across the street. Stopped by an internet cafe to
consult Google about the best route out of town. Navigating cities is pretty
daunting, I prefer the open rural roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped by a gas station on my way out to fill up my stove’s fuel bottle with
gas. The attendants and patrons got a kick out of me waiting in line with the
cars for my turn to wheel up to the pump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 full fuel canister = 22 cents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biked about 50 miles to the small coastal village of Puerto Cayo. When I pictured biking the 150 or so miles of the &lt;em&gt;Ruta del Sol&lt;/em&gt;, I imagined
a leisurely ride under the gentle caress of the sun, along a smooth beach road, never to far from the surf. When I tired, I would simply pull over and enjoy the sweet fresh nectar from a downed coconut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the &lt;em&gt;Ruta del Sol&lt;/em&gt; at this season isn’t particularly sunny, but when
the sun does show itself it is an intense and painful. Of course I forgot
sunscreen. Now I’m not just the strange guy on a bike, I’m the strange beet-colored gringo on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also turns out the route itself is quite hilly, with many climbs and
descents. Nothing to steep, but more than I was expecting. Oh, and those
coconuts cost a $1 each, as the locals have already collected them for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illusion shattered. Oh well, I’m having a blast despite the hills and raging sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/25087682_xJgC4d&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Ruta-del-Sol-Bicycle/i-PrCJw9W/0/M/630713347210cab6e4f3o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Manta, Ecuador&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekend of work suddenly dissolved after a short conference call in the
morning. With that out of the way it was time to hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packed up my panniers, attached them to the bike and made off for the bus station in the early afternoon. Ticket for the 4-hour journey from Guayaquil to Manta by bus was $4. Decided to bus it because I’m itching to get to the coast, and I’ve received quite a few warnings that biking out of Guayaquil isn’t the best idea. My bike wasn’t the strangest thing to go underneath the bus, one family had a live goat they tethered next to my bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride was fun. Sat next to a stunning Ecuadorian girl with long coffee colored hair and a cute chubby little boy who loved to pull at my whiskers. Arrived in Manta shortly before dusk. No reservation. No map. No guidebook.
Just my loaded bike and some grimy busy streets to explore. Took off in
a direction that looked promising. Passed by the beach, saw a hostel sign: $10 for
the night, private room+bathroom, “hot water”, and cable TV. Good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend Ho!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked all day in the hostel lobby. Who knows what the staff and other patrons
(all Ecuadorian) thought of the weird, nerdy gringo camped in front of his
computer for 8+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broke up the bike box in the early afternoon. Amazingly, there was no damage to the frame, despite my shoddy packing job. Assembly was straightforward, and after tweaking the front brake, everything appeared to be working. Took it for a spin in the golden dusk on the streets of Guayaquil. Ate Chinese again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight from Miami was uneventful. Successfully retrieved my bicycle from the
baggage claim and passed through customs with only cursory glance from the
officials. They seemed more interested in the little boxes of electronics Ecuadorians
were bringing home, than my large, table-sized box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a taxi proved challenging, as none of the little foreign four-doors
could fit the large bicycle box. After much frantic scrambling on their part–the &lt;em&gt;taxistas&lt;/em&gt; didn’t want to lose my business, even though I wasn’t going anywhere without their help–they found a driver with a hatchback and I made it to the hostel before noon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postponed assembling my bike as work was calling. Worked all afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Adventure Illusion or: how I learned to stop thinking and just ride a bike</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion.html" />

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/24/the-adventure-illusion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/USA/First-Bike-Tour/25087660_2LRWDS&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/USA/First-Bike-Tour/i-VBDPMRd/0/M/6261287261bf8e030261o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
My bike packed up, ready for an adventure. Bring it on world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people ask me why I’m always moving about, I usually respond with some excuse I cook up on the spot. “&lt;em&gt;Oh, well I’m trying to figure out where I want to settle down.&lt;/em&gt;” or “&lt;em&gt;I just enjoy the change in scenery.&lt;/em&gt;” Both true, but not the ultimate cause responsible for my nomadic tendencies. That would be the itch. Also known as wanderlust, though I prefer the term ‘itch’ to ‘wanderlust’ as it captures the peculiar tingling or irritating feeling wanderlust induces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/16/...and-we%27re-back.html&quot; title=&quot;...and we&#39;re back!&quot;&gt;my last update&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that the itch that began growing in Ecuador expected something more than a change from now familiar surroundings. In addition to the tingling sense telling me to move on, another tingling required adventure. It is difficult to describe, but I knew simply jumping across borders would not satisfy this compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;This is going to be awesome!&lt;/em&gt;”, I thought to myself, “&lt;em&gt;I am going to do something legendary,and have great stories when it’s over.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I set out preparing an adventure. It was more impulse than careful consideration that ended in me choosing bicycle touring–long distance cycling–through South America as a great adventure. What could be more adventurous than powering myself, with my own two legs, through foreign lands, my ‘saddlebags’ packed full of my worldly possessions, prepared to handle whatever nature throws my way? I envisioned myself the next Amelia Earhart, Captain James Cook, or Lewis and Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of my preparations (gear lists, spreadsheet budgets, route maps, etc.), that annoying side of my brain–you know, the one that pestered me into a Philosophy major–suddenly perked up with a perturbing question that stopped my planning cold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But Casey, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; adventure?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a question might sound silly, but those of you who know the overly-analytical-me know right well that I have to answer these types of questions. After all, if I’m planning an adventure, I better have some inkling of what an adventure looks like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure&quot; title=&quot;Adventure - Dictionary.com&quot;&gt;The dictionary&lt;/a&gt; is always a good place to start when you want to know what something &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;adventure&lt;/strong&gt;: [...] &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; a bold, usually risky undertaking; hazardous action of uncertain outcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems to be pretty intuitive, no? An adventure isn’t just a risky undertaking, it is a &lt;em&gt;bold&lt;/em&gt; risky undertaking, otherwise we wouldn’t admire it as an adventure, but, rather, disdain it as a foolish or reckless undertaking. The second part of the definition also has a certain semantic charm, for who would describe a hazardous action of &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; outcome as adventurous? Walking in front of a bus is by most accounts hazardous, but hardly an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have a simple rubric to determine if an activity can be considered an adventure or not: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it bold?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it risky?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it of uncertain outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huzzah! My bicycle touring plans surely satisfied these three criteria, which should have satisfied that pesky brain. I should have been able to return to the fun questions, such as, “how much water should I carry?” or “should I pack instant coffee or a portable coffee maker?” Unfortunately, that was not the end of my ruminations over adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was surrounded on one metaphorical side by route maps, budget spreadsheets, guidebooks, and bicycle touring blogs, while on the other side loomed the image of adventure placed upon a pedestal, casting its disapproving shadow over the whole lot. How could I possibly claim to be planning an adventure, when every minutiae is carefully considered? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every centimeter of our little blue-green ball has been scanned and photographed by metal marvels in space. That footage has been analyzed and dumped into your cellphone. Your universally accepted plastic card is a key usable in one of those magic street-side contraptions that spits out money wherever you are (unless it is Discover). Pervasive global communication has annihilated the concept of distance. Using Skype you can wish your dear mum in Boston happy birthday no matter if you’re in Buffalo, Bangalore, or Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention those packaged guidebooks detailing every conceivable tourist destination, with precise street maps, and convenient accommodation reviews in 3 lines or less. Gone are the days of loading out your dog sled train with salt pork, a bushel of apples, and a cask of ale, then heading out into the great white unknown. Between books, e-books, blogs, travel websites, travel magazines, podcasts, and Internet forums, nearly everything you could want to do has not only been done, but been documented in detail online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsteviesees/5197141917/&quot; title=&quot;Bearded Man by Stevie Benintende, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5197141917_f2cc0c1b5f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Bearded Man&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;There&#39;s no adventure left in the world! It&#39;s all used up.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, cries the old grizzly man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these sources remove the boldness and uncertainty from the equation. You can learn everything there is to know about a trip or destination by reading what others have done without even leaving your home. Moreover, the mere fact that countless people before you have trekked that trail, seen those ruins, or ridden through that country and then blogged about it, makes that undertaking decidedly less bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re left, then, with just a risky undertaking, but even the risk is tempered by the torrent of information available on the Internet and in books. Every potential mishap can be identified and countered. All that remains is an undertaking, and there’s nothing particularly meaningful or exciting about undertakings. Popping down the street to buy some milk is an undertaking. Hopping onto a plane to the Pyramids is an undertaking. In this light, how is independent travel all that different from mainstream packaged tours? Is travel ever really an adventure in this modern era?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does that leave us wanna-be adventurers? Compared to the famous explorers and adventurers, we’re hardly doing anything more exciting than visiting a neighboring town that is more or less the same as ours. Thank you globalization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how much good ol’ adventure is left in the world? If there is any, where and what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thought isn’t healthy, and I don’t buy into these conclusions. I need to stop these romantic comparisons to famous explorers; it is unfair to ourselves and even disrespectful to their legacy. Adventure still abounds. Achieving it just might take a bit more effort, particularly when it comes to ignoring those modern conveniences that can spoil our adventure with foreknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/01/26&quot; title=&quot;Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/aAUqP.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also something to be said for personal adventure, that is adventure framed in your own personal experience. If you’ve never left your home country, then taking a packaged tour or cruise is definitely an adventure. Hell, for me, navigating the mall during the holiday season can be as much an adventure as climbing volcanoes in the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adventure is everywhere, but recognizing it requires a shift in perspective. The English writer G.K. Chesterton eloquently puts this sentiment into words: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;G.K. Chesterton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take that pesky brain! Adventure is that which puts me outside my comfort zone. It doesn’t matter if I’ve got a cellphone in my pocket, a guidebook in my pack, and a credit card in my wallet, if I’m pumping 60lbs of bike and gear up an Andean slope, or through a Peruvian desert, by golly, I’m having an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to find &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; adventure wherever it may be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/10/16/...and-we're-back</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/10/lazy.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Open!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why hello there. It has been 82 days, since my last update, that is 2 months, 2 weeks and 6 days. Most of you surely know I’m not dead. Some of you may know I’m no longer in Ecuador. My excuse for not writing has been that since my camera was broken, I couldn’t possibly do any updates. After all, people come here for the pictures, not the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you, the reader,  should blame the malevolent horse who cruelly stepped on my camera, breaking it, and depriving you of my witty ramblings. Don’t blame me, the lazy author who couldn’t bother jotting down a few sentences once every couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog serves two purposes. One is to keep my family and friends updated with my travels, which I’ve never been quite comfortable with. That entire premise reeks of ostentatiousness. The second purpose, also an overtly self-centered goal, is to practice writing, something I don’t get to do as often as I would like since graduating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve failed on both points. I’ll try and bring you up-to-date here by giving a quick update of the last two months, and I promise to keep the embellishments to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July I moved into an apartment in Quito, visited the beach, climbed some volcanoes, went rappelling, rafting, and made some great friends. In August I worked. A lot. My new roommates considered me some sort of antisocial monster who was allergic to sunlight and fresh air. August also saw me sharing goodbyes with some expat friends. Goodbyes are never fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September consisted of more work, though I did break through the hermit spell, and began socializing again. I even managed to do some camping and attempted to climb another volcano. I say attempt, because we were foiled by some wily fog. Future tip: double check the trail you’re embarking on is the trail that leads to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sappy metaphorical way, that hike through the fog turned out to be the impetus for my leaving Quito. More precisely, it was the conversation with my hiking partner that changed my course, though it took several weeks of mental incubation before I fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become stagnant in Quito. Reflecting on my time there, I can’t say what quelled my wanderlust. Was it Quito or Ecuador itself, the people I was hanging out with, or a little of both? Regardless, I enjoyed my time there immensely. The people, landscape, and, most importantly, my friends were captivating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, after that conversation the familiar itch returned. It was time to move again; however, this time the itch felt different. Jumping across a border into new scenery wasn’t sufficient to scratch the itch. This time the itch demanded “&lt;em&gt;adventure&lt;/em&gt;,” something risky and different. I blame my hiking friend for infecting me with this silly notion. Although, in fairness to her, I have always had a latent desire for the unknown and unexpected. It saddens me to say this, because it is a character flaw, but anything less than uncomfortable, unknown, and ambiguous tends to bore me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to leave Quito came suddenly. It was Saturday when I booked a flight on Monday. More goodbyes were had. They still aren’t fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now I am back stateside preparing for my next trip. More on that shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you can walk back to the town and get one”, responded my other friend matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first friend gazed with resentment at the 20m of soft sandy beach between her and the town, sighed, and lugubriously took a seat on the towel giving up on the ice-cream for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know,” started the second friend, &lt;strong&gt;“these aren’t real problems.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed at the absurdity of getting in a huff over a short walk on a beautiful beach to an ice-cream vendor. Such is the lethargic lifestyle you slip into after a few days in a relaxing beach town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two days. Now we’re in a frantic dash through the town searching for the bus we booked 24 hours prior, but it has already left without us. We dawdled too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public bus rolls up and a crowd of people rush toward it. Being in a pretty remote location along the coast of Ecuador, we know this bus might be our only chance to make it out tonight. In true Ecuadorian fashion we push and shove our way inside and claim 2 seats for ourselves. Even though I’m still barefoot I take one for the team and stand in the grimy, muddy aisle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus pulls out into the night, and only then do we think to ask if it will drop us off anywhere near to where we need to be. We have 10pm tickets for our overnight bus from Libertad to Quito. It is 7:30pm, and with at least a 1.5hr ride from Montanita–though public buses are notorious for taking longer by taking frequent stops–we’ll be cutting it close.  We don’t even know where we need to go to catch our bus in Libertad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cockroach or two skitter across my feet, but I barely notice as I’m locked in struggle against gravity to keep my balance as the bus careens around black corners while crossing into the incoming lane. Meanwhile, worries are wheeling through my mind: &lt;em&gt;what’s&lt;/em&gt; going to happen &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we miss our bus? &lt;em&gt;What if&lt;/em&gt; we can’t find the terminal? We all have work tomorrow morning, we’re probably going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in an unfamiliar city at night with no plans for accommodation, much less a simple notion of where you are in the city is never a great idea. Given that this is Ecuador, the streets at night are most likely dangerous. Great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver puts in a 90s dance mix, and the soul-searching strain of Haddaway’s “What is Love?” drifts above the raucous teenagers partying in the rear and the oppressive droning of the engine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;object style=&quot;height: 305px; width: 500px&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/0YXuq25BMVI?version=3&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/0YXuq25BMVI?version=3&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haddaway&#39;s &quot;What is Love&quot; for your blog sing-along pleasure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I begin to quietly sing along–&lt;em&gt;What is love?&lt;/em&gt;–I mentally take a step back and laugh at the absurdity of the situation–&lt;em&gt;Oh baby, don’t hurt me&lt;/em&gt;. Here I am, caught up in a huff about some minor transportation setbacks–&lt;em&gt;Don’t hurt me no more&lt;/em&gt;–while on my way back from a luxurious beach getaway where I spent more in a weekend than people in the villages we’re driving past make in a two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sage words of my friend suddenly coalesced in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These aren&#39;t real problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout all my travels, I’ve yet to encounter a truly dire setback, and I think I’ve had my share of memorable obstacles: getting H1N1 in Egypt, ending up 8 hours off-course in remote eastern Turkey after a 12hr bus ride, taking sketchy private “taxis” at 1am from a Jordanian port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/23/coming-out-so-to-speak.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I professed my desire to start framing my day-to-day life in the context of the moment, that is, I’ve resolved to put less emphasis on long term plans and issues. This is because I had let my perspective grow disproportionally large. There were so many goals and problems I was trying to court, that I simply felt overwhelmed. By contracting the scale of my outlook, I’ve been able to make my goals and problems manageable again. While I still believe this to be the right attitude for me to adopt, I am cognizant of the fact that I can’t become utterly consumed with the present lest I lose valuable perspective in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your problems can appear much more grievous and exigent than they would be if you placed them against the proper backdrop. Taking a mental step back and surrendering a little chuckle about your circumstances can make all the difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the lurching bus, I bopped my head to Haddaway with a shit-eating grin on my face. We’d make it home, and if we didn’t, well, that would be another adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Coming out...so to speak</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/4076310756/&quot; title=&quot;The Road by Stuck in Customs, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4076310756_e35702feec.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;The Road&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part confession and part announcement. I need to come clean about a decision I’ve been wrestling with for months and decided weeks ago but have yet to share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m extending my trip indefinitely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of you this may not be much of a surprise, but I’ve decided to transition to a permanent traveling (&lt;em&gt;nomadic&lt;/em&gt;, if you will) lifestyle. This trip to Ecuador is not a vacation or an after-graduation treat, rather it is the first step in a journey that will take me (I hope) around the world. It is the next stage in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few professions that are location independent and can support perpetual travel. The traditional professions of nomads have been musicians, writers, teachers, and volunteers (i.e., those who exchange work for food/accommodation). However, the widespread adoption of the Internet and computing technology in general has given rise to another profession suited to a nomadic lifestyle: &lt;em&gt;the high-tech hobo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly fortunate to have developed the necessary passion and skills necessary to support my wandering lifestyle, because I certainly don’t have what it takes to be a professional musician or writer. Teaching and volunteering are two occupations I plan to try someday, in fact sooner than you might think, but that is for another post. Whether I can succeed at this lifestyle is another question, one I’ve spent the last month trying to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 6 weeks I used as a trial period to determine if I could actually work while traveling. I had serious doubts as to whether I could perform my duties with just a tiny netbook and random wifi hotspots. As a programmer you come to expect (and take for granted) certain luxuries, such as the workstation below I used for the last year until I graduated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;My old glass desk with two 24 inch computer monitors&quot; src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/07/desk-500.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this all really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked me a year ago if I could work full-time with a 10 inch monitor instead of two 24 inch screens, I would have laughed you out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just several months ago I was shopping around for a fancy “programmer’s chair”. These ergonomic chairs are designed to serve the ‘eccentric’ needs of programmers and other working professionals who sit in front of a computer desk for hours and hours at a time. They cost upwards of a $1000! Not too long ago I was certain I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to have one of these chairs; I thought I couldn’t work fulltime without one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for the past month I’ve been spending my working hours on couches, benches, bar stools, and bunk-beds. Yes, my backside hurts, my spine isn’t too happy, and my hands are cramped from using such a tiny keyboard, &lt;strong&gt;but I’m not trapped in an office or a cubicle&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;That alone&lt;/em&gt; is worth the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;A small plain wooden chair and desk&quot; src=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/uploads/2011/07/wood-desk-500.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current work place. Fancy chairs, screens, and desks be damned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! There. It’s out. This was a difficult decision that has been long in the making. It involved sacrificing some other dreams, and in future posts I might discuss how I got to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure what I am going to do once I tire of traveling, for I know it is not realistic to believe I’ll always be consumed with this wanderlust. Though, at this point I’m not planning that far ahead. I’ve been planning my whole life since I was 13 years old. Right now my plans extend as far the end of August when my Ecuador visa expires. After that, who knows? Colombia? Peru? Africa? I’ll worry about that when I get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough planning. Enough thinking. &lt;strong&gt;It’s time to live in the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;stb-info_box&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;A Year Later&quot; href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2012/10/08/a-year-later.html&quot;&gt;Update: I reflect upon this decision a year later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Dancing in Pujili</title>

   <updated>2011-07-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   
   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/07/02/dancing-in-pujili</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past couple weeks I have been hanging out with a local Ecuadorian named Ana. She’s originally from here in Quito, but is well traveled and speaks English quite well, though I try to to get by in Spanish as much as possible. Her best personality trait, and the reason I’m even writing this update on this topic, is just how friendly and open she is about sharing her country and culture. Case in point, after only hanging out twice she invited me to travel with her family on a day-trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pujil%C3%AD&quot;&gt;Pujili, Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; (that’s &lt;em&gt;Poo-hi-li&lt;/em&gt;) to watch the Corpus Christi Festival. Without her I wouldn’t have had this unforgettable experience, thanks Ana!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-xBDtrP2/0/M/58733101108419497598o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Not such a flattering picture for the girl on the right, but I love this picture for the color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is the Festival of Corpus Christi, a Catholic holiday here that &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to coincide with the traditional Inca holiday celebrating the Sun God. The main event is a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; dancing parade, followed by loads of drinking and cockfights. It lasts all weekend, but unfortunately I could only visit on Saturday. People come from all over Ecuador, even Colombia and Bolivia, representing their local culture (both past and present) by dressing up in traditional dress and dancing in the parade. Allegedly, some of the costume and dancing styles date back to the Incas themselves, though I’m no historian, I just enjoy watching the myriad colors and differences in designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-Kbf4D2J/0/M/5872764501c2d6fe99eeo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/i-2vKpP3k/0/M/58727638958f255fab1co-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
These two photos illustrate the large differences in regional style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recounting of this festival wouldn’t be complete without a mention of liquor, and in particular &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; experience with it. It is a custom among the parade-goers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056165044&amp;amp;k=ndg6rm5&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=M&quot;&gt;offer the dancers liquor&lt;/a&gt; as they bounce by, which is all well and fine, though I suspect many of the dancers are quite smashed by the time they reach the end of the parade. &lt;em&gt;Another&lt;/em&gt; custom is for those in the parade to offer liquor to the spectators, &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Fiesta-de-Corpus/25088005_NwtDq9#!i=2056166395&amp;amp;k=fk2x437&amp;amp;lb=1&amp;amp;s=M&quot;&gt;usually from little plastic jugs&lt;/a&gt; and a single shared shot glass. I have nothing against this custom, per se, as sharing your local brew is as important as sharing your costumes; however, there was some understood rule that &lt;em&gt;the gringos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; try &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the liquor. I admit I don’t blend in particularly well in my REI rain-jacket, polyester pants, and, oh yea, my &lt;strong&gt;glowing white skin&lt;/strong&gt;, but I tried to keep my back to the wall and observe as best I could (all my pictures were taken from the sidelines). Needless to say, once the fellows with the shot glasses got a lock on the gringo beacon, they made a beeline in our direction, arms outstretched, ready to pour some vile, burning liquid down our throats. After the third or fourth I was pretty much done, but to refuse was unthinkable, so I developed a routine to deal with the pain: smile, mutter “&lt;em&gt;salut&lt;/em&gt;”, glug glug, grimace, yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if the festivities were boring already, the locals thought of another way to liven things up: dance with the foreigners! At first I refused because I’m a horrible dancer–these were clearly professionals–and I wanted to keep playing my invisible observer role, or at least that’s what I was telling myself. In reality when you travel, you’re never invisible, and the locals have the same right to look at you as you do at them. In this case I wasn’t being harassed by the locals (even though that is how it felt at times), far from it indeed! They were simply being gracious hosts and trying to make the experience as fun for both of us as possible. Being drawn into the local culture, especially at their request, is special, and truth be told, it was disrespectful to sit there watching and taking pictures but refusing to get involved. “&lt;em&gt;I really don’t like dancing&lt;/em&gt;”, I kept telling myself, but a crucial part of traveling is getting outside your comfort zone, something I had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Escaping the City</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/26/escaping-the-city.html" />
   <published>2011-06-26T00:00:00+02:00</published>
   
   <updated>2011-06-26T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   
   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/26/escaping-the-city</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks I’ve essentially been living in Quito, Ecuador. Most people would probably disagree that I’m ‘living’ here, after all, I’ve only been here four weeks. While I don’t claim to know Quito particularly well, it certainly feels like I’m living here. For me, ‘living’ someplace implies a routine or a certain regularity to your activities. ‘Traveling’ suggests just the opposite. Travelers rarely do the same thing more than once in the same location. For example, I walk the same way to Spanish lessons every day, frequent the same grocery store, and grab an espresso at the same cafe. Travelers might do some of those things, but it would be exceptional for one to make a repeat visit. Whereas, I have fallen into a predictable routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wake up around 6:30 am&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee until 7am&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work until 9am&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spanish Lessons until 1pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work until 6 or 7pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinks with a local or foreigner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In bed by 11 pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, ‘living’ some place involves a sense of permanency that I don’t associate with my stay here in Quito. When people ask why I am in Quito I answer “learning Spanish”; I’m not here to work and I’m not merely here to see the tourist attractions. Quito is an interesting city, and I really enjoy getting to know her and her people, but I won’t stay forever. Being here on a tourist visa places a hard limit on the length of time I can be in Ecuador. Even if I choose to renew my visa for another three months, I won’t spend the entire duration in Quito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another indication that I’m living in Quito, or at least begun to tire of my routine, is how agitated I felt last week with the desire to escape the city for several days. While the noise, traffic, and pollution in Quito aren’t near as bad as Cairo (where I lived for a year), they do take a toll on your mental state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/guigz/412712855/&quot; title=&quot;Quito by Guillaume Lavaure, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/412712855_ba4bddd89d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;Quito&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quito isn&#39;t as tranquil as this photo would suggest. (by Guillaume Lavaure on Flickr)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I decided I wanted to get out, so I began a semi-frantic search for somewhere to go. Via this great site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchsurfing.org&quot;&gt;Couch Surfing&lt;/a&gt; (a facebook-esque site for travelers—I’ll write more about it at some point), I met an American named Lindsay. She had a tent and the same itch to escape our urban confinement. We made our plans on Friday: check out a region high in the Andes mountains called Quilotoa, hike around, and camp somewhere if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no clue if camping was a possible, apparently camping isn’t a popular activity in Ecuador. Optimistic that we would figure it out, we hopped on a bus early Saturday morning for Latacunga, a city several hours south of Quito. Once there we hopped onto another bus headed past Quilotoa, or so we thought. As is often the case when there is a language barrier, the shared understanding you have with someone is rarely as shared as you think . After a very, very bumpy two hours careening around corners and nearly going over the cliffs several times, we pulled into the small town of Zumbahua and were told to get off. Unfortunately, Lindsay had suffered a bad case of motion sickness during the journey (it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pretty), so we thought we were being kicked off short of our destination for disturbing the passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the bus just didn’t go all the way to Quilotoa, which we would have known had be bothered to read our guide books or do any sort of planning. We stood around scratching our heads, wondering “what now?”, for a total of 30 seconds before a local pounced offering to give us a ride in his truck for the modest (&lt;em&gt;cough cough&lt;/em&gt;) fee of $6. We should have bargained, but we didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056124976&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-RLTSkp6/0/M/5854748129dae74d19b9o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Hitching a ride in the back of a truck from Zumbahua to Quilotoa. This is Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping off the truck in Quilotoa we were greeted with the vista below. Quilotoa is located on the edge of a large crater lake. Eight hundred years ago the volcano here exploded violently, leaving this beautiful caldera lake. The locals say it is bottomless, but scientists put it at an astonishing 820 feet deep (almost as tall as the empire state building).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056125010&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-NPtpx7F/0/M/585474833174967edb43o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eating some lunch and making sure Lindsay had recovered from the bus ride, we began the hike around the rim. Once again, had we done a little planning we would have known the rim was a much longer hike than it looked—a good five hours for fit hikers, which we were not. We started around two in the afternoon, confident we would make it back before dark. When six ‘o clock rolled around, we were barely 60% of the way around and the sun was rapidly disappearing behind the horizon.  We had been looking for the opportunity to camp, and thanks to our carelessness, we had stumbled right into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With darkness came the wind and cold. We made a fire, but it was hard won. The wind was fierce, the kindling wet, and good firewood scarce, though we had demonstrated our first ounce of forethought by collecting semi-dry branches while hiking once it became apparent we would not make it all the way around before dusk. Even with the wood, our prospects for a fire looked bleak and Lindsay began to doubt that I had ever been a Boy Scout. Using half a pack of travel tissues I was able to make the fire hot enough to ignite the branches. We enjoyed our canned tuna next to our sad little fire as you can see in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning brought a cloudless sky and beautiful views of the countryside. We dismantled camp, spread and buried the remains of our fire (I’m happy to report we left no trace, aside from missing wood), and got back on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour and a half into the remainder of the crater rim hike, we encountered a Fred and Thomas, a Swiss and German, hiking from Quilotoa to Chugchilán, a small village about a 4.5 hour hike away. They invited us to join them. Not having any concrete plans and unsure of what we would do once we made it back to the Quilotoa village, their invitation sounded like a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leg of the trek was even better than the crater rim trail. The trail took us down the side of a mountain, across the valley in the middle, and up the other side to the town. The views were stunning! Along the way we encountered many locals making the trek themselves with produce or livestock in tow. At times we felt pretty stupid for puffing and sweating from exertion, and lugging our big packs around, while the locals whizzed along in perfect shape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056126183&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-hqT7NvD/0/M/5854754883a9d063d5c0o-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
From this point we hiked down (see trail on left/bottom), across the valley, and then back up to the town of Chugchilan 7.5 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to to Chugchilán just as it started to rain. Exhausted and starving we sought out a meal in the town, but being Sunday most places were closed. A local hostel owner saw us as a ripe business opportunity, though I would like to think she just took pity on us, and opened her kitchen. After a simple but satisfying meal we thanked our host and politely refused the offer to stay at $16 per night. Instead we implored a local truck owner to drive us back to Zumbahua, where we could catch a proper bus to Latacunga and finally Quito. He wanted $40, which was $10 more than the usual rate, but we didn’t have much of a choice, and he knew it. While the driver happily fastened a tarp on the top of the truck, Thomas observed that the ride back along bumpy, unpaved roads in a rigid wooden truck-bed would be very uncomfortable. He recommended (in true German spirit) that we should buy a crate of beer to ease our suffering. We heartily agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/25087633_TBwvCX#!i=2056126348&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hiking-Quilotoa-to/i-2hg4xn4/0/M/5855308242eaa9bc5f1fo-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Exhausted, but full and slightly tipsy on our way back to Zumbahua&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Zumbahua it was straightforward getting buses back to Quito. That night, in my hostel bed, falling asleep to the sounds of car alarms and awful karaoke didn’t bother me as much as before. We’ll see how long it lasts. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ecuador Ransoming Protected Rainforest?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joshbousel/4056414751/&quot; title=&quot;Yasuni National Park by joshbousel, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imghead&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/4056414751_38ff922420.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; alt=&quot;Yasuni National Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this article (&lt;a href=&quot;http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN0522204620110606&quot;&gt;Ecuador’s Yasuni jungle protection plan&lt;/a&gt;) by Reuters I couldn’t help but get the impression that Ecuador is ransoming its rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that’s not quite what the article says, but reading between the lines I certainly get the impression that Ecuador is telling the world “&lt;em&gt;Hey World! Give us a bunch of money or we’ll destroy this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=ECU+02&amp;amp;mode=all&quot;&gt;UNESCO protected&lt;/a&gt; nature reserve.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly an environmental activist (or oil advocate either), but this route seems pretty low. This stunt will allow Ecuador to blame everyone else but themselves if they have to start oil extraction in the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Ecuador is morally in the clear?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/21/an-amazon-expedition-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a title=&quot;An Amazon Expedition (part 1)&quot; href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/post/6339375909/an-amazon-expedition-part-1&quot;&gt;I last left the story&lt;/a&gt; of my Amazon trip, my new friends and I had boarded a canoe &lt;!--END--&gt;and   headed into the Amazon Rainforest. The area we were headed into is called the Cuyabeno, a   portion of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. The Cuyabeno is a series of interconnected   lakes, lagoons, rivers, and floating forests that eventually drains into the Amazon River.   It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough with the book facts. &lt;em&gt;What did we do there? &lt;/em&gt;I had trouble writing this update, as there was simply so much involved in this trip. I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how to give the reader a peek into the experience we had in the rainforest. Rather than gloss it over with a jazzy narrative or a play-by-play of each day, I am going to include a few photos of memorable moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on jungle hikes, where our guide used natural ingredients to create a stomach   soothing concoction for Oli (the one with the hat).
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Amazon-Rainforest/25087862_XRWZb8#!i=2056152627&amp;k=w8SFmrX&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Amazon JungleCollecting ingredients for a native drink that cures upsets stomachs.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Amazon-Rainforest/i-w8SFmrX/0/M/58189953290d93351e28o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Amazon JungleCollecting ingredients for a native drink that cures upsets stomachs.&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon JungleCollecting ingredients for a native drink that cures upsets stomachs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went fishing for and caught red-bellied piraña.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw giant spiders, snakes, cockroaches, and other giant bugs straight out of a horror   film.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went swimming in the gorgeous lagoons.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After swimming, we silently watched the brilliant sun set over the forest teeming with the   sound of life.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate, slept and showered in thatched wooden huts on stilts.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed and played cards by candle light. We shared a miserable rainy jungle trek, and   bonded over hours of grueling paddling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My words can&amp;#8217;t begin to describe all that went into the experience. The photos can do a slightly better job, but so much of the experience was un-capturable by camera. In the end, the total experience is a only a shared memory of those seven people you see above, which is a special, yet at the same time a somber fact. We came together for a short time, strangers from all over the world, shared intense and unforgettable moments, and then scattered back into the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Amazon Expedition (part 1)</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/08/an-amazon-expedition-part-1.html" />
   <published>2011-06-08T00:00:00+02:00</published>
   
   <updated>2011-06-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   
   <id>http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/08/an-amazon-expedition-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent 3 nights and 4 days deep in the Amazon Jungle. It was unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi27gr0qs1qzc5xr.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip started with an 8 hour overnight bus ride from Quito (where I&amp;#8217;m based in Ecuador) to the small oil city of Lago Agrio close to the Colombian border. This was my first extended bus ride in Ecuador. Going in I was wary, as I had heard several scary stories about Ecuadorian buses. For the most part I was worried about scams and ruses to separate me from (and then run off with) my bag. For example, a common ruse is to use a pretty girl or friendly face to distract you while a partner reaches under your chair (from the chair behind yours) and steals stuff from your bag (or takes the whole thing). Thankfully I didn&amp;#8217;t have any problems aside from not getting much sleep. I placed my bag on the floor between my feet, and was so wary that every little bump or sway caused me to jerk awake in alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus arrived in Lago Agrio at the fresh hour of 7am. Being the stubborn and stingy type, I refused to take a $1.00 taxi to the prescribed meeting point (a hotel in the center of town). Instead, I used the little map the travel agent had given me to walk there, after all, the map made it appear that the hotel was a mere 5-6 blocks away. After wandering through mostly poor and fairly sketchy neighborhoods for 20 minutes, it became clear the map was more of a conceptual guide (e.g., the hotel is down and left from the bus station) than a navigational aid (e.g., walk one block on Luis street, then turn right on &amp;#8230; etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my fledgling Spanish (&amp;#8220;Dónde &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;some street name&amp;gt;?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;), I sought directions from the locals. As is apparently typical of small Ecuadorian cities, none of the streets were signed and few locals even knew their names! I did happen across a few knowledgeable and helpful locals who gave what I suppose were decent directions in Spanish, but, of course, I couldn&amp;#8217;t understand them. In the end hand frantic hand waving saved the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this experience I have developed this short&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictionary of Hand Waving Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;one wave in a direction and a tilt of the head = &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;should I go this way?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;one wave in a direction and nod = &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;that way is probably right. I don&amp;#8217;t know for sure, but don&amp;#8217;t want to be embarrassed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;using two hands (in clapping position) to show distance = &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;how far should I go?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;strong multiple waves in a direction = &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;go a long way!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (or, maybe,&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;get out of here!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally stumbled upon the hotel, because I noticed several gringos lounging in chairs and sipping coffee out front. I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen one gringo during my trek, so I figured these ones must be on to something. Even the hotel lacked clear signage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gringos were in fact waiting for the same jungle expedition as I, so I joined them for a simple breakfast of coffee and eggs (literally, just coffee and eggs. There was no salt, pepper, hot sauce, fruit, or bread). The group consisted of me, the token American, a 30-ish Swiss accountant, a 20-something French woman, and two 20-something Canadian sisters (Geological engineer and nurse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We busied ourselves with food and introductory conversation. I would become fairly well acquainted with these gringos over the next 4 days, for we were all in the same group. We ate, slept, explored, and almost literally (explanation forthcoming) showered together. Of course, at this point in the story we didn&amp;#8217;t know any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:00&amp;#160;o&amp;#8217; clock rolled around and our transportation arrived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next leg of the journey was yet another bus ride. This time in a smaller bus and a length of only 2 and a half hours. With a quick pit stop at the airport to pick up two more Americans (a father and 19 yr-old son), we blasted off onto a narrow, winding road into the country. As we progressed the landscape transformed from generic temperate green surroundings into exotic leafy, viney jungle. Unfortunately, I missed most of this transformation because buses put me to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I awoke we had pulled off the road and up to the edge of a river where a very long, narrow boat was waiting for us. We hustled out of the bus and loaded our belongings into the front of the boat, then donned very stinky and ill-fitting life jackets. I suspect the life-jackets were a formality of sorts whilst we were in site of the national park rangers manning the shack where we paid our $1.00 entrance fee. This was to be the only boat ride (of which we had many) where we wore life jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmi1tp2umT1qzc5xr.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited, talkative, and smelling of jungle mold, we boarded the boat two by two. Our boat driver gave the outboard motor a quick pull, the engine roared to life, and we were off! As we navigated away from the bank, I gave a quick look over my shoulder and said goodbye to civilization. Where we were headed there would be no roads: deep into the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It would appear I am somewhat wordy. 700 words in and I&amp;#8217;ve only just gotten to the jungle bit, so I am going to split this trip across multiple posts. Check back in a day or two for the sequel.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve posted the rest of the story, along with photos, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elusivetruth.net/2011/06/21/an-amazon-expedition-part-2.html&quot; title=&quot;An Amazon Expedition (part 2)&quot;&gt;in this update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t worry, they are just tiny little mosquito bites. I have been assured that aside from itching like heck (they are called fire mosquitos), the bites and spots are perfectly harmless. They are a small price to pay for the experience of camping in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest far removed from civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll post more pictures and a story or two about the trip soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the equator makes it possible (or easier) to balance an egg, because of the opposing forces. In fact, the guide claimed all sorts of things are different at the equator: our weight, our strength, the direction water spirals, etc. I&amp;#8217;m quite skeptical of all these claims, though I did manage to balance an egg on a nail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a baked Guinea Pig, known is Spanish as &lt;em&gt;Cuy&lt;/em&gt; (Koo-ee), prepared in the traditional Ecuadorian fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The texture is quite like that of roasted chicken, but the flavor is decidedly porkish. The skin is very thick and (in my opinion) quite gross, not at all like the nice crispy skin of a chicken or juicy fat chunks from a beef steak.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Solo traveling is an inherently complicated and risky endeavor. A foreigner wandering city streets alone makes an inviting quarry for street toughs and petty thieves. Even something simple as going to the bathroom when in a restaurant or cafe becomes difficult as the solitary traveler has no one to watch their things or their back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Solo Traveler by Sparky_R, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkys_pics/3381805319/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Solo Traveler&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3637/3381805319_e397d5d84f.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand traveling unaccompanied is an immensely rewarding experience. The fewer number of people in a group, the easier it is to make decisions, and believe me when I say that decision making can paralyze a group and turn a would-be fun day (or trip!) into one remembered only for the arguments and amount of grief shared by all. When you are a group of one, the task of deciding where to eat, what to visit, how long to stay, etc., is completely up to your taste and inclinations. To travel with others often involves sacrificing self autonomy for group think, something I&amp;#8217;m not particularly keen on. When alone you can follow your feelings and instincts without having to put them into words to convince a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this update devolves into a treatise on solo travel, I want to share a recent story that came about because I was traveling alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday morning at my hostel in Quito, Ecuador I was sipping my coffee and tallying the previous day&amp;#8217;s expenses in my little black notebook when a tall gringo walked in and busied himself with making a breakfast of toast and juice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakfast room is a great location for meeting fellow travelers. Swapping backgrounds and tales of adventures over a steaming cup of café is great way to shake of the morning grogginess. This swapping started of as most do: &amp;#8220;Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Casey. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? How long are you traveling? Why &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;insert current location&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#8221;. The tall gringo turned out to be a fellow named Mike from Pennsylvania who had volunteered with low-income families and kids here in Quito for 2 years about 15 years ago. He comes back every year for 10 days to visit the kids (who&amp;#8217;ve grown up) and various friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we swapped our plans for the weekend. Mine were pretty boring. This particular weekend in Quito was a holiday, so everything was shuttered and the streets were empty as people left for the beaches or countryside. I planned to stay inside and read a book, do some work, etc. As it turned out Mike was behaving like a local; and getting out of town. He had an old college (U Penn) friend who owns a Hacienda about 45 minutes out of Quito. Mike planned to spend weekend at the Hacienda visiting his friend&amp;#8217;s family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened next only occurred because I was traveling solo. After hearing and politely praising (but feeling inwardly jealous) Mike&amp;#8217;s plans, he suddenly asked if I would like to accompany him. I suppose he took pity on my meager weekend plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting the offer was risky, with out a doubt, for I did not know this man inviting me out into the countryside, but it was simply too good to pass up. The proposition was surreal: accompany him by taxi (for free) to the Hacienda, eat dinner with the family (for free), sleep in one of the many guest rooms (for free), take two more meals (for free), and relax all Sunday on the estate&amp;#8217;s grounds. Had I booked a similar trip through proper channels I would have paid upwards of $500, and that wouldn&amp;#8217;t have included the quality time with an Ecuadorian family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I went! It was utterly fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/25087727_6tJhzK#!i=2056136129&amp;k=G3VTrQ2&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/i-G3VTrQ2/0/M/577854767065e0cbb4cao-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front.&quot; alt=&quot;Hacienda La CarrionaThe chapel with an old covered buggy sitting out front.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Hacienda La Carriona&quot; href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Hacienda-La-Carriona/25087727_6tJhzK&quot;&gt;Click here to view all photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I took quite a few pictures of the estate&amp;#8217;s grounds, though I shied away from taking many inside as I didn&amp;#8217;t want to come across as a nosy outsider photographing the private sanctum of this family&amp;#8217;s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos are pretty self explanatory. All in all it was a great experience getting a peek into Ecuadorian family life. Admittedly, this family is in the extreme upper class (they have live in servants), so the peek wasn&amp;#8217;t representative of Ecuadorian life, nonetheless it was a unique experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I been in a group, I never would have been invited into this family&amp;#8217;s home. Chalk one up to solo travel.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Packing ultra-light</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2011/05/30/packing-ultra-light.html" />

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being separated from their luggage is fear shared by all budget travelers. This phobia is colloquially known as Backpackers Separation Anxiety (BSA). Often when traveling by bus or van, everyone&amp;#8217;s luggage is heaped together in the underside storage compartment accessible from the outside. If the bus makes frequent stops the only guard you have against someone grabbing your bag is the trustworthiness of your fellow passengers, not a comforting situation. Not to mention that checking baggage when flying is inherently risky, and, more recently, a significant expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this aversion to being separated from one&amp;#8217;s pack, it is crucial that the sum total of your belongings can be easily carrier on your back, stuffed in overhead bins, and even under seats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this trip was to use a bag less than 30 liters (1800 cu. in.) and a packed weight of less than 15 lbs. Mouse over the items to see what they are.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161703&amp;k=WLNL4ns&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Ecuador: All the clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-WLNL4ns/0/M/57693831805111b87542o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ecuador: All the clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot; alt=&quot;Ecuador: All the clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see I brought 2 sets of pants, shirts, boxer briefs, and socks; one cotton t-shirt; one set of long underwear; one pair of sandals; one stuffable rain/wind jacket; and one pair of shoes. I am always wearing at least one set of clothing, so only one set is packed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing laundry every night or every other night becomes a necessity when you pack like this. A relaxed self esteem is also required, as you&amp;#8217;re probably not going to look very fashionable and people will definitely notice you wearing the same clothes day after day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161735&amp;k=jwSjDhp&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-jwSjDhp/0/M/5768843811e7bb812dd2o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot; alt=&quot;Ecuador: All the non-clothing items I&#39;m bringing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-clothes supplies are fairly standard travelers gear: travel pouch, guidebook, clothesline, drain plug, soap, music device, flashlight, water bottle, lots of zip-loc bags, rubber bands, watch, notebooks and pens, sewing kit, and pack towel. Originally I wanted to avoid bringing a computer, opting instead to store my files on a small USB key, but when I decided I was going to work while traveling I was forced to bring a small netbook computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/25087963_kLv8MR#!i=2056161677&amp;k=WFwwg4h&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A&quot; title=&quot;EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos.elusivetruth.net/Ecuador/Ecuador-Quito/i-WFwwg4h/0/M/57693829828d9a87cd32o-M.jpg&quot; title=&quot;EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)&quot; alt=&quot;EcuadorEverything packed into a 28 liter bag (toliet roll for size comparison)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all my gear packed into my 28 liter (1700 cu. in) backpack next to a toilet paper roll for size comparison. It not only easily fits into the carry on bins, but also fits under the seat of most airplanes. In the end it ended up weighing about 18 lbs, more than the 15 lbs goal I had set, but I attribute that to the heavy laptop and charging cables thrown in at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this pack I can travel through civilization in reasonable comfort indefinitely, and rarely separate from my belongings.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Close Call at the Coiffeur</title>
   <link href="http://elusivetruth.net/2009/05/28/a-close-call-at-the-coiffeur.html" />

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Zamalek or Ahly?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; asked the barber as he grazed the straight-edge razor across my Adam&amp;#8217;s Apple. Maybe he anticipated my flinch or maybe I&amp;#8217;m just lucky to have escaped an accidental throat slitting. Either way I didn&amp;#8217;t muse over my fortuitousness for more than a second, because the barber was eyeing me through the mirror expectantly, with his blade still at my throat. My Adam&amp;#8217;s Apple&amp;#8217;s wellbeing was on the razor&amp;#8217;s edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some background facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ahly and Zamalek are the two most famous soccer clubs in Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in Egypt, then you&amp;#8217;re either for Ahly or Zamalek.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Egyptians are intensely fanatical about their soccer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick scan of the room viewable in the mirror didn&amp;#8217;t reveal any clues to which team he supported, so I had a 50-50 chance. Even if I had the Arabic vocabulary to express my general apathy for soccer (not to be misconstrued as dislike) I suspect he would have assumed I was for his rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guessed Zamalek. Goal! The razor began moving again, phew! After touting my love for Club Zamalek and bashing Ahly (those losers!) the conversation topic changed to English Action Films, and I enjoyed the remainder of my shave.&lt;/p&gt;
